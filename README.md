# Bible Clock
Clock using chapter/verse quotes from the Bible, based on work and idea by
        [Jaap Meijers](http://www.eerlijkemedia.nl/) ([E-reader clock](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/)).
        
The working site is in the docs/ folder, and can be visited at https://lifegems.github.io/bible-clock. 
To run it locally you need to serve docs/ with an HTTP server (e.g. `npx http-server docs`) or just open index.html.
