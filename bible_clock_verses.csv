00-00||The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures
00-01|Jude|Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, but a brother of James, to the called ones who are loved by God the Father and preserved for Jesus Christ:
00-02|Jude|May mercy and peace and love be increased to you.
00-03|Jude|Beloved ones, although I was making every effort to write you about the salvation we hold in common, I found it necessary to write you to urge you to put up a hard fight for the faith that was once for all time delivered to the holy ones.
00-04|Jude|My reason is that certain men have slipped in among you who were long ago appointed to this judgment by the Scriptures; they are ungodly men who turn the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for brazen conduct and who prove false to our only owner and Lord, Jesus Christ.
00-05|Jude|Although you are fully aware of all of this, I want to remind you that Jehovah, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those not showing faith.
00-06|Jude|And the angels who did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place, he has reserved with eternal bonds in dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.
00-07|Jude|In the same manner, Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and the cities around them also gave themselves over to gross sexual immorality and pursued unnatural fleshly desires; they are placed before us as a warning example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.
00-08|Jude|Despite this, these men too are indulging in dreams, defiling the flesh, despising authority, and speaking abusively of glorious ones.
00-09|Jude|But when Miʹcha·el the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses’ body, he did not dare to bring a judgment against him in abusive terms, but said: “May Jehovah rebuke you.”
00-10|Jude|But these men are speaking abusively about all the things they really do not understand. And in all the things that they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animals, they go on corrupting themselves.
00-11|Jude|Too bad for them, for they have followed the path of Cain and have rushed into the erroneous course of Baʹlaam for reward, and they have perished in the rebellious talk of Korʹah!
00-12|Jude|These are the rocks hidden below water at your love feasts while they feast with you, shepherds who feed themselves without fear; waterless clouds carried here and there by the wind; fruitless trees in late autumn, having died twice and having been uprooted;
00-13|Jude|wild waves of the sea that cast up the foam of their own shame; stars with no set course, for which the blackest darkness stands reserved forever.
00-14|Jude|Yes, the seventh one in line from Adam, Eʹnoch, also prophesied about them when he said: “Look! Jehovah came with his holy myriads
00-15|Jude|to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.”
00-16|Jude|These men are murmurers, complainers about their lot in life, following their own desires, and their mouths make grandiose boasts, while they are flattering others for their own benefit.
00-17|Jude|As for you, beloved ones, call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00-18|Jude|how they used to say to you: “In the last time there will be ridiculers, following their own desires for ungodly things.”
00-19|Jude|These are the ones who cause divisions, animalistic men, not having spirituality.
00-20|Jude|But you, beloved ones, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, and pray with holy spirit,
00-21|Jude|in order to keep yourselves in God’s love, while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view.
00-22|Jude|Also, continue showing mercy to some who have doubts;
00-23|Jude|save them by snatching them out of the fire. But continue showing mercy to others, doing so with fear, while you hate even the garment that has been stained by the flesh.
00-24|Jude|Now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling and to make you stand unblemished in the sight of his glory with great joy,
00-25|Jude|to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity. Amen.
00-01|Obadiah|The vision of O·ba·diʹah: This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says regarding Eʹdom: “We have heard a report from Jehovah, An envoy has been sent among the nations: ‘Rise up, let us prepare for battle against her.’” 
00-02|Obadiah|“Look! I have made you insignificant among the nations; You are utterly despised.
00-03|Obadiah|The presumptuousness of your heart has deceived you, You who reside in the retreats of the crag, Dwelling in the height, saying in your heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the earth?’
00-04|Obadiah|Even if you make your dwelling high like the eagle, Or if you place your nest among the stars, I would bring you down from there,” declares Jehovah.
00-05|Obadiah|“If thieves would come to you, robbers by night, (How utterly you will be destroyed!) Would they not steal only what they wanted? Or if it were grape gatherers who would come to you, Would they not leave some gleanings behind?
00-06|Obadiah|O how Eʹsau has been searched out! How his hidden treasures have been sought after!
00-07|Obadiah|They have driven you to the border. All your allies have deceived you. The men at peace with you have prevailed against you. Those eating bread with you will place a net under you, But you will not discern it.
00-08|Obadiah|In that day,” declares Jehovah, “Will I not destroy the wise ones out of Eʹdom And discernment out of the mountainous region of Eʹsau?
00-09|Obadiah|And your warriors will become terrified, O Teʹman, Because each one in the mountainous region of Eʹsau will be destroyed in the slaughter.
00-10|Obadiah|Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob, Shame will cover you, And you will perish forever.
00-11|Obadiah|On the day when you stood off to the side, On the day when strangers took his army into captivity, When foreigners entered his gate and cast lots over Jerusalem, You acted like one of them.
00-12|Obadiah|You should not gloat over your brother’s day on the day of his misfortune, You should not rejoice over the people of Judah on the day of their perishing, And you should not speak so arrogantly on the day of their distress.
00-13|Obadiah|You should not come into the gate of my people in the day of their disaster, You should not gloat over his calamity in the day of his disaster, And you should not lay your hands on his wealth in the day of his disaster.
00-14|Obadiah|You should not stand at the crossroads to slaughter his escapees, And you should not hand over his survivors in the day of distress.
00-15|Obadiah|For the day of Jehovah against all the nations is near. As you have done, so it will be done to you. The way you treated others will come back on your own head.
00-16|Obadiah|For in the way that you have drunk on my holy mountain, All the nations will keep drinking constantly. They will drink and gulp down, And they will be as though they had never existed.
00-17|Obadiah|But on Mount Zion will be those who escape, And it will be holy; And the house of Jacob will take possession of the things belonging to them.
00-18|Obadiah|The house of Jacob will become a fire, The house of Joseph a flame, And the house of Eʹsau like stubble; They will set them ablaze and consume them, And there will be no survivor of the house of Eʹsau, For Jehovah himself has spoken.
00-19|Obadiah|They will take possession of the Negʹeb and the mountainous region of Eʹsau, Of the She·pheʹlah and the land of the Phi·lisʹtines. They will take possession of the field of Eʹphra·im and the field of Sa·marʹi·a, And Benjamin will take possession of Gilʹe·ad.
00-20|Obadiah|To the exiles of this rampart, To the people of Israel will belong the land of the Caʹnaan·ites as far as Zarʹe·phath. And the exiles of Jerusalem, who were in Se·pharʹad, will possess the cities of the Negʹeb.
00-21|Obadiah|And saviors will go up on Mount Zion To judge the mountainous region of Eʹsau, And the kingship will become Jehovah’s.”
09-01|Judges|In time A·bimʹe·lech the son of Jer·ub·baʹal went to his mother’s brothers in Sheʹchem, and he said to them and to all the family of his grandfather:
09-02|Judges|“Please ask all the leaders of Sheʹchem, ‘Which is better for you, for all 70 sons of Jer·ub·baʹal to rule over you or for one man to rule over you? And remember that I am your own bone and flesh.’”
09-03|Judges|So his mother’s brothers said this in his behalf to all the leaders of Sheʹchem, and their hearts were inclined to follow A·bimʹe·lech, for they said: “He is our own brother.”
09-04|Judges|Then they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the house of Baʹal-beʹrith, and A·bimʹe·lech used it to hire idle and insolent men to accompany him.
09-05|Judges|After that he went to his father’s house at Ophʹrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jer·ub·baʹal, 70 men, on one stone. The only survivor was Joʹtham, the youngest son of Jer·ub·baʹal, because he hid.
09-06|Judges|Then all the leaders of Sheʹchem and all Beth-milʹlo gathered together and made A·bimʹe·lech king, close by the big tree, by the pillar that was in Sheʹchem.
09-07|Judges|When they reported it to Joʹtham, he at once went and stood on the top of Mount Gerʹi·zim and called out in a loud voice to them: “Listen to me, you leaders of Sheʹchem, and then God will listen to you.
09-08|Judges|“Once there were trees that went to anoint a king over them. So they said to the olive tree, ‘Rule over us.’
09-09|Judges|But the olive tree said to them, ‘Must I give up my oil, which they use to glorify God and men, to go and wave over the other trees?’
09-10|Judges|Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-11|Judges|But the fig tree said to them, ‘Must I give up my sweetness and my good fruitage to go and wave over the other trees?’
09-12|Judges|Next the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-13|Judges|The vine replied to them, ‘Must I give up my new wine that makes God and men rejoice to go and wave over the trees?’
09-14|Judges|Finally all the other trees said to the bramble, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-15|Judges|At this the bramble said to the trees, ‘If you are really anointing me as king over you, come and seek refuge under my shadow. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebʹa·non.’
09-16|Judges|“Now have you acted sincerely and honorably in making A·bimʹe·lech king, and have you shown goodness toward Jer·ub·baʹal and his household, and have you treated him as he deserves?
09-17|Judges|When my father fought for you, he risked his life to save you from Midʹi·an’s hand.
09-18|Judges|But today you have risen up against my father’s household and killed his sons, 70 men, on one stone. Then you made A·bimʹe·lech, the son of his slave girl, king over the leaders of Sheʹchem just because he is your brother.
09-19|Judges|Yes, if you are acting sincerely and honorably toward Jer·ub·baʹal and his household this day, rejoice over A·bimʹe·lech and let him also rejoice over you.
09-20|Judges|But if not, may fire come out of A·bimʹe·lech and consume the leaders of Sheʹchem and Beth-milʹlo, and may fire come out of the leaders of Sheʹchem and Beth-milʹlo and consume A·bimʹe·lech.”
09-21|Judges|Then Joʹtham fled and escaped to Beʹer, and he lived there because of his brother A·bimʹe·lech.
09-22|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech ruled over Israel for three years.
09-23|Judges|Then God let hostility develop between A·bimʹe·lech and the leaders of Sheʹchem, and they dealt treacherously with A·bimʹe·lech.
09-24|Judges|This was so that the violence done to the 70 sons of Jer·ub·baʹal might be avenged, so as to place responsibility for their blood on their brother A·bimʹe·lech for killing them and on the leaders of Sheʹchem for helping him to kill his brothers.
09-25|Judges|So the leaders of Sheʹchem set men to ambush him on the mountaintops, and they would rob everyone who passed by them on the road. In time it was reported to A·bimʹe·lech.
09-26|Judges|Then Gaʹal son of Eʹbed and his brothers crossed over into Sheʹchem, and the leaders of Sheʹchem put their trust in him.
09-27|Judges|They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards, trod them out, and held a festival, after which they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and cursed A·bimʹe·lech.
09-28|Judges|Then Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed said: “Who is A·bimʹe·lech, and who is Sheʹchem that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jer·ub·baʹal, and is not Zeʹbul his commissioner? Serve the men of Haʹmor, Sheʹchem’s father! But why should we serve him?
09-29|Judges|If only this people were under my command, I would depose A·bimʹe·lech.” Then he said to A·bimʹe·lech: “Increase your army and come out.”
09-30|Judges|When Zeʹbul the prince of the city heard the words of Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed, his anger blazed.
09-31|Judges|So he secretly sent messengers to A·bimʹe·lech, saying: “Look! Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed and his brothers are now in Sheʹchem, and here they are inciting the city against you.
09-32|Judges|Now come up by night, you and your men, and lie in wait in the field.
09-33|Judges|As soon as the sun rises in the morning, you should get up early and attack the city; and when he and his men come out against you, do whatever you can to defeat him.”
09-34|Judges|So A·bimʹe·lech and all the people with him rose up by night, and in four bands they lay in wait against Sheʹchem.
09-35|Judges|When Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, A·bimʹe·lech and the people with him rose up from the ambush.
09-36|Judges|When Gaʹal saw the people, he said to Zeʹbul: “Look! There are people coming down from the mountaintops.” But Zeʹbul said to him: “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”
09-37|Judges|Gaʹal later said: “Look! People are coming down from the center of the land, and one band is coming by the way of the big tree of Me·onʹe·nim.”
09-38|Judges|Zeʹbul replied to him: “Where now is your boast, ‘Who is A·bimʹe·lech that we should serve him?’ Are these not the people you rejected? Go out now and fight against them.”
09-39|Judges|So Gaʹal went out at the head of the leaders of Sheʹchem and fought against A·bimʹe·lech.
09-40|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech pursued him, and Gaʹal fled from him, and many fell slain as far as the entrance of the city gate.
09-41|Judges|And A·bimʹe·lech continued to dwell in A·ruʹmah, and Zeʹbul drove Gaʹal and his brothers out of Sheʹchem.
09-42|Judges|The next day the people went out into the field, and A·bimʹe·lech was told about it.
09-43|Judges|So he took the people and divided them into three bands and lay in wait in the field. When he saw the people going out of the city, he attacked them and struck them down.
09-44|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech and the bands with him charged forward and took a position at the entrance of the city gate, while two bands attacked all who were in the field, and they struck them down.
09-45|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech fought against the city all that day and captured it. He killed the people in it, and then he pulled the city down and sowed it with salt.
09-46|Judges|When all the leaders of the tower of Sheʹchem heard about this, they immediately went to the vault of the house of El-beʹrith.
09-47|Judges|As soon as it was reported to A·bimʹe·lech that all the leaders of the tower of Sheʹchem had gathered together,
09-48|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech and all the men with him went up Mount Zalʹmon. A·bimʹe·lech took an ax in his hand and cut off a tree branch and lifted it on his shoulder and said to the people with him: “What you saw me do, hurry and do the same!”
09-49|Judges|So all the people also cut off branches and followed A·bimʹe·lech. Then they put the branches against the vault and set the vault on fire. So all the people of the tower of Sheʹchem also died, about 1,000 men and women.
09-50|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech then went to Theʹbez; he camped against Theʹbez and captured it.
09-51|Judges|There was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men and women and all the city leaders fled there. They shut themselves in and climbed onto the roof of the tower.
09-52|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech made his way to the tower and attacked it. He approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire.
09-53|Judges|Then one of the women dropped an upper millstone on A·bimʹe·lech’s head and crushed his skull.
09-54|Judges|He quickly called the attendant bearing his weapons and said to him: “Draw your sword and put me to death, so that they may not say about me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So his attendant ran him through, and he died.
09-55|Judges|When the men of Israel saw that A·bimʹe·lech was dead, they all went back home.
09-56|Judges|Thus God repaid A·bimʹe·lech for the evil that he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers.
09-57|Judges|God also made all the evil of the men of Sheʹchem come back on their own heads. So the curse of Joʹtham the son of Jer·ub·baʹal came upon them.
08-01|Luke|Shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with him,
08-02|Luke|as were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magʹda·lene, from whom seven demons had come out;
08-03|Luke|Jo·anʹna the wife of Chuʹza, Herod’s man in charge; Su·sanʹna; and many other women, who were ministering to them from their belongings.
08-04|Luke|Now when a large crowd had gathered together with those who went to him from city to city, he spoke by means of an illustration:
08-05|Luke|“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some of them fell alongside the road and were trampled on, and the birds of heaven ate them up.
08-06|Luke|Some landed on the rock, and after sprouting, they dried up because they had no moisture.
08-07|Luke|Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with them choked them.
08-08|Luke|But others fell on the good soil, and after sprouting, they produced 100 times more fruit.” As he said these things, he called out: “Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.”
08-09|Luke|But his disciples asked him what this illustration meant.
08-10|Luke|He said: “To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of God, but for the rest it is in illustrations so that, though looking, they may look in vain, and though hearing, they may not get the sense.
08-11|Luke|Now the illustration means this: The seed is the word of God.
08-12|Luke|Those alongside the road are the ones who have heard, and then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved.
08-13|Luke|Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy, but these have no root. They believe for a while, but in a season of testing, they fall away.
08-14|Luke|As for that which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, but by being carried away by anxieties, riches, and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to maturity.
08-15|Luke|As for that on the fine soil, these are the ones who, after hearing the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.
08-16|Luke|“No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light.
08-17|Luke|For there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest, nor anything carefully concealed that will never become known and not come out in the open.
08-18|Luke|Therefore, pay attention to how you listen, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.”
08-19|Luke|Now his mother and brothers came to him, but they were unable to get near him because of the crowd.
08-20|Luke|So it was reported to him: “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
08-21|Luke|In reply he said to them: “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”
08-22|Luke|One day he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them: “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So they set sail.
08-23|Luke|But as they were sailing along, he fell asleep. And a violent windstorm descended on the lake, and their boat began to fill up with water and to be in danger.
08-24|Luke|So they went and woke him up, saying: “Instructor, Instructor, we are about to perish!” With that he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they subsided, and a calm set in.
08-25|Luke|Then he said to them: “Where is your faith?” But they were filled with fear and were astounded, saying to one another: “Who really is this? For he orders even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”
08-26|Luke|And they put in to shore in the region of the Gerʹa·senes, which is on the side opposite Galʹi·lee.
08-27|Luke|As Jesus got out onto land, a demon-possessed man from the city met him. For a considerable time he had not worn clothing, and he was staying, not in a house, but among the tombs.
08-28|Luke|At the sight of Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice, he said: “What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”
08-29|Luke|(For Jesus had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. It had seized him on many occasions, and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the isolated places.)
08-30|Luke|Jesus asked him: “What is your name?” He said: “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.
08-31|Luke|And they kept pleading with him not to order them to go away into the abyss.
08-32|Luke|Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain, so they pleaded with him to permit them to enter into the swine, and he gave them permission.
08-33|Luke|With that the demons came out of the man and went into the swine, and the herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and drowned.
08-34|Luke|But when the herders saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.
08-35|Luke|Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, and they grew fearful.
08-36|Luke|Those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been made well.
08-37|Luke|Then a great number from the surrounding region of the Gerʹa·senes asked Jesus to go away from them, because they were gripped by great fear. Then he went aboard the boat to depart.
08-38|Luke|However, the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging to continue with him, but he sent the man away, saying:
08-39|Luke|“Go back home, and keep on relating what God did for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.
08-40|Luke|When Jesus returned, the crowd received him kindly, for they were all expecting him.
08-41|Luke|But look! a man named Jaʹi·rus came; this man was a presiding officer of the synagogue. And he fell at the feet of Jesus and began to plead with him to come to his house,
08-42|Luke|because his only daughter, who was about 12 years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the crowds pressed in on him.
08-43|Luke|Now there was a woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years, and she had not been able to get a cure from anyone.
08-44|Luke|She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment, and immediately her flow of blood stopped.
08-45|Luke|So Jesus said: “Who touched me?” When they were all denying it, Peter said: “Instructor, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing against you.”
08-46|Luke|But Jesus said: “Someone touched me, for I know that power went out of me.”
08-47|Luke|Seeing that she had not escaped notice, the woman came trembling and fell down before him and declared before all the people why she touched him and how she was healed immediately.
08-48|Luke|But he said to her: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
08-49|Luke|While he was yet speaking, a representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came, saying: “Your daughter has died; do not bother the Teacher any longer.” 50 On hearing this, Jesus answered him: “Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be saved.”
08-51|Luke|When he reached the house, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the girl’s father and mother.
08-52|Luke|But people were all weeping and beating themselves in grief for her. So he said: “Stop weeping, for she did not die but is sleeping.”
08-53|Luke|At this they began to laugh at him scornfully, because they knew she had died.
08-54|Luke|But he took her by the hand and called to her: “Child, get up!”
08-55|Luke|And her spirit returned, and she rose immediately, and he ordered that something be given her to eat.
08-56|Luke|Well, her parents were beside themselves, but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
09-01|Genesis|God went on to bless Noah and his sons and to say to them: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth.
09-02|Genesis|A fear of you and a terror of you will continue upon every living creature of the earth and upon every flying creature of the heavens, upon everything that moves on the ground and upon all the fish of the sea. They are now given into your hand.
09-03|Genesis|Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. Just as I gave you the green vegetation, I give them all to you.
09-04|Genesis|Only flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.
09-05|Genesis|Besides that, I will demand an accounting for your lifeblood. I will demand an accounting from every living creature; and from each man I will demand an accounting for the life of his brother.
09-06|Genesis|Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image He made man.
09-07|Genesis|As for you, be fruitful and become many, and increase abundantly on the earth and multiply.”
09-08|Genesis|Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
09-09|Genesis|“I am now establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you,
09-10|Genesis|and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the living creatures of the earth with you, all those that came out of the ark—every living creature of the earth.
09-11|Genesis|Yes, I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood, and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.”
09-12|Genesis|And God added: “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations.
09-13|Genesis|I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
09-14|Genesis|Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud.
09-15|Genesis|And I will certainly remember my covenant that I made between me and you and every living creature of every kind; and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.
09-16|Genesis|And the rainbow will occur in the cloud, and I will certainly see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind on the earth.”
09-17|Genesis|God repeated to Noah: “This is the sign of the covenant that I establish between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
09-18|Genesis|Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth. Ham later became the father of Caʹnaan.
09-19|Genesis|These three were Noah’s sons, and all the earth’s population came from them and spread abroad.
09-20|Genesis|Now Noah started off as a farmer, and he planted a vineyard.
09-21|Genesis|When he drank of the wine, he became intoxicated, and he uncovered himself inside his tent.
09-22|Genesis|Ham, the father of Caʹnaan, saw his father’s nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside. 
09-23|Genesis|So Shem and Jaʹpheth took a garment and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backward. Thus they covered their father’s nakedness while their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.
09-24|Genesis|When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,
09-25|Genesis|he said: “Cursed be Caʹnaan. Let him become the lowest slave to his brothers.”
09-26|Genesis|And he added: “Praised be Jehovah, the God of Shem, And let Caʹnaan become a slave to him.
09-27|Genesis|Let God grant ample space to Jaʹpheth, And let him reside in the tents of Shem. Let Caʹnaan become a slave to him also.”
09-28|Genesis|Noah continued to live for 350 years after the Flood.
09-29|Genesis|So all the days of Noah amounted to 950 years, and he died.
09-01|Luke|Then he called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.
09-02|Luke|And he sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal,
09-03|Luke|and he said to them: “Carry nothing for the trip, neither staff nor food pouch nor bread nor money; neither have two garments.
09-04|Luke|But wherever you enter into a home, stay there and leave from there.
09-05|Luke|And wherever people do not receive you, on going out of that city, shake the dust off your feet for a witness against them.”
09-06|Luke|Then starting out, they went through the territory from village to village, declaring the good news and performing cures everywhere.
09-07|Luke|Now Herod the district ruler heard about everything that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised up from the dead,
09-08|Luke|but others were saying that E·liʹjah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.
09-09|Luke|Herod said: “John I beheaded. Who, then, is this about whom I am hearing such things?” So he was trying to see him.
09-10|Luke|When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus all they had done. With that he took them along and withdrew privately into a city called Beth·saʹi·da.
09-11|Luke|But the crowds, getting to know it, followed him. And he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the Kingdom of God, and he healed those needing a cure.
09-12|Luke|Then the day was coming to a close. The Twelve now came up and said to him: “Send the crowd away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and provisions, because out here we are in an isolated place.”
09-13|Luke|But he said to them: “You give them something to eat.” They said: “We have nothing more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy food for all these people.”
09-14|Luke|There were, in fact, about 5,000 men. But he said to his disciples: “Have them sit down in groups of about 50 each.”
09-15|Luke|And they did so and had them all sit down.
09-16|Luke|Taking now the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke them up and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
09-17|Luke|So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftovers, 12 baskets of fragments.
09-18|Luke|Later, while he was praying alone, the disciples came to him, and he questioned them, saying: “Who are the crowds saying that I am?”
09-19|Luke|In reply they said: “John the Baptist, but others say E·liʹjah, and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”
09-20|Luke|Then he said to them: “You, though, who do you say I am?” Peter answered: “The Christ of God.”
09-21|Luke|Then in a stern talk to them, he instructed them not to tell this to anybody,
09-22|Luke|but he said: “The Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.”
09-23|Luke|Then he went on to say to all: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and keep following me.
09-24|Luke|For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake is the one who will save it.
09-25|Luke|Really, what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers ruin?
09-26|Luke|For whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels.
09-27|Luke|But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God.”
09-28|Luke|In fact, about eight days after saying these words, he took Peter, John, and James along and climbed up the mountain to pray.
09-29|Luke|And as he was praying, the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became glitteringly white.
09-30|Luke|And look! two men were conversing with him; they were Moses and E·liʹjah.
09-31|Luke|These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure, which he was about to fulfill at Jerusalem.
09-32|Luke|Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
09-33|Luke|And as these were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus: “Instructor, it is fine for us to be here. So let us erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for E·liʹjah.” He did not realize what he was saying.
09-34|Luke|But as he was saying these things, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them. As they entered into the cloud, they became afraid.
09-35|Luke|Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying: “This is my Son, the one who has been chosen. Listen to him.”
09-36|Luke|As the voice spoke, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet and did not report to anyone in those days any of the things they saw.
09-37|Luke|The following day when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
09-38|Luke|And look! a man called out from the crowd, saying: “Teacher, I beg you to take a look at my son, because he is my only one.
09-39|Luke|And look! a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth, and only with difficulty does it leave him after bruising him.
09-40|Luke|I begged your disciples to expel it, but they could not.”
09-41|Luke|In response Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with you and put up with you? Bring your son over here.”
09-42|Luke|But even as he was approaching, the demon hurled him to the ground and violently threw him into a convulsion. However, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
09-43|Luke|And they were all astounded at the majestic power of God. While they were all astonished at all the things he was doing, he said to his disciples:
09-44|Luke|“Listen carefully and remember these words, for the Son of man is going to be betrayed into men’s hands.”
09-45|Luke|But they did not understand what he was saying. In fact, it was concealed from them so that they might not grasp it, and they were afraid to question him about this saying.
09-46|Luke|Then a dispute arose among them about which one of them was the greatest.
09-47|Luke|Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a young child, stood him beside him,
09-48|Luke|and said to them: “Whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me also; and whoever receives me also receives the One who sent me. For the one who conducts himself as a lesser one among all of you is the one who is great.”
09-49|Luke|In response John said: “Instructor, we saw someone expelling demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he is not following with us.”
09-50|Luke|But Jesus said to him: “Do not try to prevent him, for whoever is not against you is for you.”
09-51|Luke|As the days were drawing near for him to be taken up, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.
09-52|Luke|So he sent messengers ahead of him. And they went and entered a village of Sa·marʹi·tans to make preparations for him.
09-53|Luke|But they did not receive him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem.
09-54|Luke|When the disciples James and John saw this, they said: “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them?”
09-55|Luke|But he turned and rebuked them.
09-56|Luke|So they went to a different village.
09-57|Luke|Now as they were going along the road, someone said to him: “I will follow you wherever you go.”
09-58|Luke|But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”
09-59|Luke|Then he said to another: “Be my follower.” The man said: “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”
09-60|Luke|But he said to him: “Let the dead bury their dead, but you go and declare abroad the Kingdom of God.”
