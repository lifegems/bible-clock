00-00||The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures
01-01|Genesis|In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
01-02|Genesis|Now the earth was formless and desolate, and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep, and God’s active force was moving about over the surface of the waters.
01-03|Genesis|And God said: “Let there be light.” Then there was light.
01-04|Genesis|After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light from the darkness.
01-05|Genesis|God called the light Day, but the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.
01-06|Genesis|Then God said: “Let there be an expanse between the waters, and let there be a division between the waters and the waters.”
01-07|Genesis|Then God went on to make the expanse and divided the waters beneath the expanse from the waters above the expanse. And it was so.
01-08|Genesis|God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
01-09|Genesis|Then God said: “Let the waters under the heavens be collected together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.
01-10|Genesis|God called the dry land Earth, but the collecting of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
01-11|Genesis|Then God said: “Let the earth cause grass to sprout, seed-bearing plants and fruit trees according to their kinds, yielding fruit along with seed on the earth.” And it was so.
01-12|Genesis|And the earth began to produce grass, seed-bearing plants and trees yielding fruit along with seed, according to their kinds. Then God saw that it was good.
01-13|Genesis|And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
01-14|Genesis|Then God said: “Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night, and they will serve as signs for seasons and for days and years.
01-15|Genesis|They will serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.” And it was so.
01-16|Genesis|And God went on to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars.
01-17|Genesis|Thus God put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth
01-18|Genesis|and to dominate by day and by night and to make a division between the light and the darkness. Then God saw that it was good.
01-19|Genesis|And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
01-20|Genesis|Then God said: “Let the waters swarm with living creatures, and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”
01-21|Genesis|And God created the great sea creatures and all living creatures that move and swarm in the waters according to their kinds and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
01-22|Genesis|With that God blessed them, saying: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the waters of the sea, and let the flying creatures become many in the earth.”
01-23|Genesis|And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
01-24|Genesis|Then God said: “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds, domestic animals and creeping animals and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.
01-25|Genesis|And God went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds and the domestic animals according to their kinds and all the creeping animals of the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
01-26|Genesis|Then God said: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth.”
01-27|Genesis|And God went on to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.
01-28|Genesis|Further, God blessed them, and God said to them: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.”
01-29|Genesis|Then God said: “Here I have given to you every seed-bearing plant that is on the entire earth and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. Let them serve as food for you.
01-30|Genesis|And to every wild animal of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving on the earth in which there is life, I have given all green vegetation for food.” And it was so.
01-31|Genesis|After that God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
02-01|Genesis|Thus the heavens and the earth and everything in them were completed.
02-02|Genesis|And by the seventh day, God had completed the work that he had been doing, and he began to rest on the seventh day from all his work that he had been doing.
02-03|Genesis|And God went on to bless the seventh day and to declare it sacred, for on it God has been resting from all the work that he has created, all that he purposed to make.
02-04|Genesis|This is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.
02-05|Genesis|No bush of the field was yet on the earth and no vegetation of the field had begun sprouting, because Jehovah God had not made it rain on the earth and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
02-06|Genesis|But a mist would go up from the earth, and it watered the entire surface of the ground.
02-07|Genesis|And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person.
02-08|Genesis|Further, Jehovah God planted a garden in Eʹden, toward the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
02-09|Genesis|Thus Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.
02-10|Genesis|Now there was a river flowing out of Eʹden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four rivers.
02-11|Genesis|The name of the first is Piʹshon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Havʹi·lah, where there is gold.
02-12|Genesis|The gold of that land is good. Bdellium gum and onyx stone are also there.
02-13|Genesis|The name of the second river is Giʹhon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush.
02-14|Genesis|The name of the third river is Hidʹde·kel; it is the one going to the east of As·syrʹi·a. And the fourth river is the Eu·phraʹtes.
02-15|Genesis|Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of Eʹden to cultivate it and to take care of it.
02-16|Genesis|Jehovah God also gave this command to the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction.
02-17|Genesis|But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.”
02-18|Genesis|Then Jehovah God said: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.”
02-19|Genesis|Now Jehovah God had been forming from the ground every wild animal of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call each living creature, that became its name.
02-20|Genesis|So the man named all the domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal of the field, but for man there was no helper as a complement of him.
02-21|Genesis|So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place.
02-22|Genesis|And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.
02-23|Genesis|Then the man said: “This is at last bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, Because from man she was taken.”
02-24|Genesis|That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
02-25|Genesis|And both of them continued to be naked, the man and his wife; yet they were not ashamed.
03-01|Genesis|Now the serpent was the most cautious of all the wild animals of the field that Jehovah God had made. So it said to the woman: “Did God really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?”
03-02|Genesis|At this the woman said to the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.
03-03|Genesis|But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden: ‘You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it; otherwise you will die.’”
03-04|Genesis|At this the serpent said to the woman: “You certainly will not die.
03-05|Genesis|For God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.”
03-06|Genesis|Consequently, the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something desirable to the eyes, yes, the tree was pleasing to look at. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward, she also gave some to her husband when he was with her, and he began eating it.
03-07|Genesis|Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves.
03-08|Genesis|Later they heard the voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden about the breezy part of the day, and the man and his wife hid from the face of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.
03-09|Genesis|And Jehovah God kept calling to the man and saying to him: “Where are you?”
03-10|Genesis|Finally he said: “I heard your voice in the garden, but I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.”
03-11|Genesis|At that he said: “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat?”
03-12|Genesis|The man said: “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate.”
03-13|Genesis|Jehovah God then said to the woman: “What is this you have done?” The woman replied: “The serpent deceived me, so I ate.”
03-14|Genesis|Then Jehovah God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you are the cursed one out of all the domestic animals and out of all the wild animals of the field. On your belly you will go, and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
03-15|Genesis|And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring. He will crush your head, and you will strike him in the heel.”
03-16|Genesis|To the woman he said: “I will greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in pain you will give birth to children, and your longing will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.”
03-17|Genesis|And to Adam he said: “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate from the tree concerning which I gave you this command, ‘You must not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life.
03-18|Genesis|It will grow thorns and thistles for you, and you must eat the vegetation of the field.
03-19|Genesis|In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”
03-20|Genesis|After this Adam named his wife Eve, because she was to become the mother of everyone living.
03-21|Genesis|And Jehovah God made long garments from skins for Adam and for his wife, to clothe them.
03-22|Genesis|Jehovah God then said: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad. Now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever,—”
03-23|Genesis|With that Jehovah God expelled him from the garden of Eʹden to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken. 24 So he drove the man out, and he posted at the east of the garden of Eʹden the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning continuously to guard the way to the tree of life.
04-01|Genesis|Now Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said: “I have produced a male child with the help of Jehovah.”
04-02|Genesis|Later she again gave birth, to his brother Abel. Abel became a shepherd of the flock, but Cain became a cultivator of the ground.
04-03|Genesis|After some time, Cain brought some fruits of the land as an offering to Jehovah.
04-04|Genesis|But Abel brought some firstlings of his flock, including their fat. While Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and on his offering,
04-05|Genesis|he did not look with any favor on Cain and on his offering. So Cain grew hot with anger and was dejected.
04-06|Genesis|Then Jehovah said to Cain: “Why are you so angry and dejected?
04-07|Genesis|If you turn to doing good, will you not be restored to favor? But if you do not turn to doing good, sin is crouching at the door, and its craving is to dominate you; but will you get the mastery over it?”
04-08|Genesis|After that Cain said to his brother Abel: “Let us go over into the field.” So while they were in the field, Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him.
04-09|Genesis|Later on, Jehovah said to Cain: “Where is your brother Abel?” and he said: “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?”
04-10|Genesis|At this He said: “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.
04-11|Genesis|And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
04-12|Genesis|When you cultivate the ground, it will not give you back its produce. You will become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth.”
04-13|Genesis|At this Cain said to Jehovah: “The punishment for my error is too great to bear.
04-14|Genesis|Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your face; and I will become a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and anyone who finds me will certainly kill me.”
04-15|Genesis|So Jehovah said to him: “For that reason, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times.” So Jehovah set up a sign for Cain in order that no one finding him would strike him.
04-16|Genesis|Then Cain went away from before Jehovah and took up residence in the land of Exile, to the east of Eʹden.
04-17|Genesis|Afterward Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Eʹnoch. Then he engaged in building a city and named the city after his son Eʹnoch.
04-18|Genesis|Later Iʹrad was born to Eʹnoch. And Iʹrad became father to Me·huʹja·el, and Me·huʹja·el became father to Me·thuʹsha·el, and Me·thuʹsha·el became father to Laʹmech.
04-19|Genesis|Laʹmech took two wives for himself. The name of the first was Aʹdah, and the name of the second was Zilʹlah.
04-20|Genesis|Aʹdah gave birth to Jaʹbal. He was the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
04-21|Genesis|His brother’s name was Juʹbal. He was the founder of all those who play the harp and the pipe.
04-22|Genesis|Also, Zilʹlah gave birth to Tuʹbal-cain, who forged every sort of tool of copper and iron. And the sister of Tuʹbal-cain was Naʹa·mah.
04-23|Genesis|Then Laʹmech composed these words for his wives Aʹdah and Zilʹlah: “Hear my voice, you wives of Laʹmech; Give ear to my saying: A man I have killed for wounding me, Yes, a young man for striking me.
04-24|Genesis|If 7 times Cain is to be avenged, Then Laʹmech 77 times.”
04-25|Genesis|Adam again had sexual relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth because, as she said, “God has appointed for me another offspring in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.”
04-26|Genesis|There was also born to Seth a son, and he named him Eʹnosh. At that time people began calling on the name of Jehovah.
09-01|Genesis|God went on to bless Noah and his sons and to say to them: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth.
09-02|Genesis|A fear of you and a terror of you will continue upon every living creature of the earth and upon every flying creature of the heavens, upon everything that moves on the ground and upon all the fish of the sea. They are now given into your hand.
09-03|Genesis|Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. Just as I gave you the green vegetation, I give them all to you.
09-04|Genesis|Only flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.
09-05|Genesis|Besides that, I will demand an accounting for your lifeblood. I will demand an accounting from every living creature; and from each man I will demand an accounting for the life of his brother.
09-06|Genesis|Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image He made man.
09-07|Genesis|As for you, be fruitful and become many, and increase abundantly on the earth and multiply.”
09-08|Genesis|Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
09-09|Genesis|“I am now establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you,
09-10|Genesis|and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the living creatures of the earth with you, all those that came out of the ark—every living creature of the earth.
09-11|Genesis|Yes, I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood, and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.”
09-12|Genesis|And God added: “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations.
09-13|Genesis|I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
09-14|Genesis|Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud.
09-15|Genesis|And I will certainly remember my covenant that I made between me and you and every living creature of every kind; and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.
09-16|Genesis|And the rainbow will occur in the cloud, and I will certainly see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind on the earth.”
09-17|Genesis|God repeated to Noah: “This is the sign of the covenant that I establish between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
09-18|Genesis|Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth. Ham later became the father of Caʹnaan.
09-19|Genesis|These three were Noah’s sons, and all the earth’s population came from them and spread abroad.
09-20|Genesis|Now Noah started off as a farmer, and he planted a vineyard.
09-21|Genesis|When he drank of the wine, he became intoxicated, and he uncovered himself inside his tent.
09-22|Genesis|Ham, the father of Caʹnaan, saw his father’s nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside. 
09-23|Genesis|So Shem and Jaʹpheth took a garment and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backward. Thus they covered their father’s nakedness while their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.
09-24|Genesis|When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,
09-25|Genesis|he said: “Cursed be Caʹnaan. Let him become the lowest slave to his brothers.”
09-26|Genesis|And he added: “Praised be Jehovah, the God of Shem, And let Caʹnaan become a slave to him.
09-27|Genesis|Let God grant ample space to Jaʹpheth, And let him reside in the tents of Shem. Let Caʹnaan become a slave to him also.”
09-28|Genesis|Noah continued to live for 350 years after the Flood.
09-29|Genesis|So all the days of Noah amounted to 950 years, and he died.
13-01|Leviticus|Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and Aaron, saying:
13-02|Leviticus|“If a man develops on his skin a swelling, a scab, or a blotch and it could become the disease of leprosy on his skin, he must then be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests.
13-03|Leviticus|The priest will examine the infection on his skin. When the hair in the infection has turned white and the appearance of the infection is deeper than the skin, it is the disease of leprosy. The priest will examine it and declare him unclean.
13-04|Leviticus|But if the blotch on his skin is white and its appearance is not deeper than the skin and the hair has not turned white, the priest will then quarantine the infected person for seven days.
13-05|Leviticus|The priest will then examine him on the seventh day, and if it appears that the infection has stopped and has not spread on the skin, the priest will quarantine him for another seven days.
13-06|Leviticus|“The priest should examine him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest will declare him clean; it was only a scab. The man will then wash his garments and be clean.
13-07|Leviticus|But if the scab has definitely spread on the skin after he appears before the priest to establish his purification, he will then appear again before the priest.
13-08|Leviticus|The priest will examine it, and if the scab has spread in the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is leprosy.
13-09|Leviticus|“If the disease of leprosy develops in a man, he must then be brought to the priest,
13-10|Leviticus|and the priest will examine him. If there is a white swelling on the skin and it has turned the hair white and there is an open sore in the swelling,
13-11|Leviticus|it is chronic leprosy on his skin, and the priest will declare him unclean. He should not quarantine him, for he is unclean.
13-12|Leviticus|Now if the leprosy breaks out all over the skin and the leprosy covers the person with the disease from head to foot, as far as the priest can see,
13-13|Leviticus|and the priest has examined him and sees that the leprosy has covered all his skin, he will then declare the infected person clean. All of it has turned white, and he is clean.
13-14|Leviticus|But whenever an open sore appears in it, he will be unclean.
13-15|Leviticus|When the priest sees the open sore, he will declare him unclean. The open sore is unclean. It is leprosy.
13-16|Leviticus|But if the open sore again turns white, he will then come to the priest.
13-17|Leviticus|The priest will examine him, and if the infection has turned white, the priest will then declare the infected person clean. He is clean.
13-18|Leviticus|“If a person develops a boil on his skin and it heals,
13-19|Leviticus|but in the place of the boil a white swelling or a reddish-white blotch has developed, he must then show himself to the priest.
13-20|Leviticus|The priest will examine it, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy that has broken out in the boil.
13-21|Leviticus|But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin and appears faded, the priest will then quarantine him for seven days.
13-22|Leviticus|And if it has clearly spread on the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is a disease.
13-23|Leviticus|But if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread, it is only the inflammation from the boil, and the priest will declare him clean.
13-24|Leviticus|“Or if someone has a scar from the fire and the raw flesh of the scar becomes a reddish-white blotch or a white one,
13-25|Leviticus|the priest will then examine it. If the hair in the blotch has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the scar, and the priest will declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy.
13-26|Leviticus|But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in the blotch and it is not deeper than the skin and it is faded, the priest will then quarantine him for seven days.
13-27|Leviticus|The priest will examine him on the seventh day, and if it has clearly spread on the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy.
13-28|Leviticus|But if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread over the skin and it is faded, it is only a swelling of the scar, and the priest will declare him clean, because it is an inflammation of the scar.
13-29|Leviticus|“When a man or a woman develops an infection on the head or on the chin,
13-30|Leviticus|the priest will then examine the infection. If it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair is yellow and thin, the priest will then declare such one unclean; it is an infection of the scalp or the beard. It is leprosy of the head or of the chin.
13-31|Leviticus|But if the priest sees that the infection does not appear to be deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest should quarantine the infected person for seven days.
13-32|Leviticus|The priest will examine the infection on the seventh day, and if the infected area has not spread and no yellow hair has developed in it and the appearance of the infected area is not deeper than the skin,
13-33|Leviticus|the person should have himself shaved, but he will not have the infected area shaved. Then the priest will quarantine the infected person for seven days.
13-34|Leviticus|“The priest will again examine the infected area on the seventh day, and if the infection of the scalp and beard has not spread on the skin and it does not appear deeper than the skin, the priest must then declare him clean, and he should wash his garments and be clean.
13-35|Leviticus|But if the infection clearly spreads on the skin after his purification, 36 the priest will examine him, and if the infection has spread on the skin, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair; that person is unclean.
13-37|Leviticus|But if the examination shows that the infection has not spread and black hair has grown on it, the infection has been healed. He is clean, and the priest will declare him clean.
13-38|Leviticus|“If a man or a woman develops blotches on the skin and the blotches are white,
13-39|Leviticus|the priest will examine them. If the skin blotches are faded white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin. That person is clean.
13-40|Leviticus|“If a man loses the hair of his head and becomes bald, he is clean.
13-41|Leviticus|If he loses the hair on the front of his head and becomes bald there, he is clean.
13-42|Leviticus|But if a reddish-white sore develops on the bald part of his scalp or on his forehead, it is leprosy breaking out on his scalp or on his forehead.
13-43|Leviticus|The priest will examine him, and if the swelling from the infection is reddish-white on the bald spot on top of his head or on his forehead and it looks like leprosy on his skin, 44 he is a leper. He is unclean, and the priest should declare him unclean because of the disease on his head.
13-45|Leviticus|As for the leper who has the disease, his garments should be torn and his head should be left ungroomed and he should cover over his mustache and call out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’
13-46|Leviticus|He will be unclean the whole time that he has the disease. Since he is unclean, he should live in isolation. His dwelling place will be outside the camp.
13-47|Leviticus|“If the disease of leprosy contaminates a garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment,
13-48|Leviticus|either in the warp or in the woof of the linen or of the wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,
13-49|Leviticus|and the yellowish-green or reddish stain from the disease contaminates the garment, a skin, the warp, the woof, or any article of skin, it is a contamination from leprosy, and it should be shown to the priest.
13-50|Leviticus|The priest will examine the disease, and he must quarantine the disease for seven days.
13-51|Leviticus|When he examines the disease on the seventh day and sees that it has spread in the garment, in the warp, in the woof, or in the skin (regardless of what the skin is used for), the disease is malignant leprosy, and it is unclean.
13-52|Leviticus|He should burn the garment or the warp or the woof in the wool or in the linen or any article of skin in which the disease has developed, for it is malignant leprosy. It should be burned in the fire.
13-53|Leviticus|“But if the priest examines it and the disease has not spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin,
13-54|Leviticus|the priest will then command that they should wash the contaminated item, and he will quarantine it for another seven days.
13-55|Leviticus|The priest will then examine the contaminated item after it has been thoroughly washed. If the appearance of the contamination has not changed, even if the disease has not spread, it is unclean. You should burn it in the fire because it has been eaten away, either from its underside or from its outside.
13-56|Leviticus|“But if the priest has examined it and the contaminated part is faded after it has been thoroughly washed, he will then tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof.
13-57|Leviticus|However, if it still appears in another part of the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, it is spreading, and you should burn any contaminated item in the fire.
13-58|Leviticus|But when the contamination disappears from the garment or the warp or the woof or any article of skin that you wash, it should then be washed a second time, and it will be clean.
13-59|Leviticus|“This is the law of the disease of leprosy in a garment of wool or of linen, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin, for declaring it clean or unclean.”
14-01|Leviticus|Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying:
14-02|Leviticus|“This is to be the law of the leper on the day his purification is established, when he is to be brought to the priest.
14-03|Leviticus|The priest will go outside the camp and examine him. If the leper has been cured of the leprosy,
14-04|Leviticus|the priest will command him to bring two live clean birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop for his cleansing.
14-05|Leviticus|The priest will command that the one bird be killed in an earthenware vessel over running water.
14-06|Leviticus|But he should take the living bird along with the cedarwood, the scarlet material, and the hyssop, and dip them together in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.
14-07|Leviticus|Then he will spatter it seven times on the one cleansing himself from the leprosy and declare him clean, and he will set the living bird free in the open field.
14-08|Leviticus|“The one cleansing himself must wash his garments and shave off all his hair and bathe in water, and he will be clean. Afterward, he may come into the camp, but he will dwell outside his tent for seven days.
14-09|Leviticus|On the seventh day, he should shave off all the hair on his head and his chin and his eyebrows. After he shaves off all his hair, he will wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and he will be clean.
14-10|Leviticus|“On the eighth day, he will take two sound young rams, one sound female lamb in its first year, three tenths of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log measure of oil;
14-11|Leviticus|and the priest who declares him clean will present the man who is cleansing himself, along with the offerings, before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
14-12|Leviticus|The priest will take the one young ram and offer it as a guilt offering together with the log measure of oil, and he will wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah.
14-13|Leviticus|Then he will slaughter the young ram in the place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are usually slaughtered, in a holy place, because, like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest. It is something most holy.
14-14|Leviticus|“Then the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest will put it on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
14-15|Leviticus|And the priest will take some of the log measure of oil and pour it into his own left palm. 16 The priest will then dip his right finger into the oil that is in his left palm and spatter some of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah.
14-17|Leviticus|Then the priest will put some of the remaining oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot over the blood of the guilt offering.
14-18|Leviticus|The priest will put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself, and the priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah.
14-19|Leviticus|“The priest will sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one cleansing himself from his impurity, and afterward he will slaughter the burnt offering.
14-20|Leviticus|And the priest will offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar, and the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be clean.
14-21|Leviticus|“However, if he is poor and does not have enough means, he will then take one young ram as a guilt offering for a wave offering, in order to make atonement for himself, along with one tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, a log measure of oil,
14-22|Leviticus|and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, according to his means. The one will serve as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering.
14-23|Leviticus|On the eighth day, he will bring them for establishing his purification to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah.
14-24|Leviticus|“The priest will take the young ram of the guilt offering and the log measure of oil, and the priest will wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah.
14-25|Leviticus|He will then slaughter the young ram of the guilt offering, and the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
14-26|Leviticus|The priest will pour some of the oil into his own left palm,
14-27|Leviticus|and he will then spatter with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before Jehovah.
14-28|Leviticus|And the priest will put some of the oil that is in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot on the same places that he put the blood of the guilt offering.
14-29|Leviticus|The priest will then put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself, in order to make atonement for him before Jehovah.
14-30|Leviticus|“He will offer up one of the turtledoves or one of the young pigeons, according to his means,
14-31|Leviticus|the one he can afford, as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering along with the grain offering; and the priest will make atonement for the one cleansing himself before Jehovah.
14-32|Leviticus|“This is the law for the one in whom the disease of leprosy was but who does not have the means when establishing his purification.”
14-33|Leviticus|Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:
14-34|Leviticus|“When you come into the land of Caʹnaan, which I am giving you as a possession, and I contaminate a house in your land with the disease of leprosy,
14-35|Leviticus|the one to whom the house belongs should then come and tell the priest, ‘Some kind of contamination has appeared in my house.’
14-36|Leviticus|The priest will give orders to clear out the house before he comes to examine the contamination, in order that he may not declare everything that is in the house unclean; and after that the priest will come in to inspect the house.
14-37|Leviticus|He will examine the affected area, and if the walls of the house are contaminated with yellowish-green or reddish depressions and they appear to be deeper than the wall surface,
14-38|Leviticus|the priest will then go out of the house to the entryway of the house and quarantine the house for seven days.
14-39|Leviticus|“Then the priest will return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the contamination has spread in the walls of the house,
14-40|Leviticus|the priest will then give orders, and the contaminated stones must be torn out and thrown outside the city into an unclean place.
14-41|Leviticus|Then he is to have the inside of the house thoroughly scraped, and the plaster and mortar that is removed should be discarded outside the city in an unclean place.
14-42|Leviticus|They will then insert other stones in the place of the stones they removed, and he should use different mortar and have the house plastered.
14-43|Leviticus|“If, though, the contamination returns and breaks out in the house after the stones were torn out and the house was scraped and replastered,
14-44|Leviticus|the priest will then go in and inspect it. If the contamination has spread in the house, it is malignant leprosy in the house. The house is unclean.
14-45|Leviticus|He will then have the house pulled down—its stones, its timbers, and all the plaster and mortar of the house—and carried outside the city to an unclean place.
14-46|Leviticus|But whoever enters the house any of the days it is quarantined will be unclean until the evening;
14-47|Leviticus|and whoever lies down in the house should wash his garments, and whoever eats in the house should wash his garments.
14-48|Leviticus|“However, if the priest comes and sees that the contamination has not spread in the house after the house was replastered, the priest will then declare the house clean, because the contamination has been healed.
14-49|Leviticus|In order to purify the house from uncleanness, he will take two birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop.
14-50|Leviticus|He is to kill the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
14-51|Leviticus|Then he will take the cedarwood, the hyssop, the scarlet material, and the live bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the running water, and he must spatter it toward the house seven times.
14-52|Leviticus|And he will purify the house from uncleanness with the blood of the bird, the running water, the live bird, the cedarwood, the hyssop, and the scarlet material.
14-53|Leviticus|He will then set the live bird free outside the city in the open field and make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.
14-54|Leviticus|“This is the law respecting any case of leprosy, infection of the scalp or the beard,
14-55|Leviticus|leprosy of the garment or the house,
14-56|Leviticus|and respecting swellings, scabs, and blotches,
14-57|Leviticus|in order to determine when something is unclean and when something is clean. This is the law about leprosy.”
15-01|1 Chronicles|And he continued building houses for himself in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the Ark of the true God and pitched a tent for it.
15-02|1 Chronicles|It was then that David said: “No one is to carry the Ark of the true God except the Levites, for Jehovah has chosen them to carry the Ark of Jehovah and to minister to him always.”
15-03|1 Chronicles|Then David congregated all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the Ark of Jehovah up to the place that he had prepared for it.
15-04|1 Chronicles|David gathered the descendants of Aaron and the Levites: 5 from the Koʹhath·ites, U·riʹel the chief and 120 of his brothers;
15-06|1 Chronicles|from the Me·rarʹites, A·saiʹah the chief and 220 of his brothers;
15-07|1 Chronicles|from the Gerʹshom·ites, Joel the chief and 130 of his brothers;
15-08|1 Chronicles|from the descendants of E·li·zaʹphan, She·maiʹah the chief and 200 of his brothers;
15-09|1 Chronicles|from the descendants of Hebʹron, Eʹli·el the chief and 80 of his brothers;
15-10|1 Chronicles|from the descendants of Uzʹzi·el, Am·minʹa·dab the chief and 112 of his brothers.
15-11|1 Chronicles|Furthermore, David called the priests Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar and the Levites U·riʹel, A·saiʹah, Joel, She·maiʹah, Eʹli·el, and Am·minʹa·dab,
15-12|1 Chronicles|and he said to them: “You are the heads of the paternal houses of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, you and your brothers, and bring the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel up to the place that I have prepared for it.
15-13|1 Chronicles|Since you did not carry it the first time, the anger of Jehovah our God broke out against us, because we did not search out the proper procedure.”
15-14|1 Chronicles|So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.
15-15|1 Chronicles|Then the Levites carried the Ark of the true God on their shoulders with the poles, just as Moses had commanded by Jehovah’s word.
15-16|1 Chronicles|David then told the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers to sing out joyfully, accompanied by musical instruments: stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals.
15-17|1 Chronicles|So the Levites appointed Heʹman the son of Joel and, of his brothers, Aʹsaph the son of Ber·e·chiʹah and, of the Me·rarʹites their brothers, Eʹthan the son of Kush·aʹiah.
15-18|1 Chronicles|Together with them were their brothers of the second division, Zech·a·riʹah, Ben, Ja·aʹzi·el, She·mirʹa·moth, Je·hiʹel, Unʹni, E·liʹab, Be·naiʹah, Ma·a·seiʹah, Mat·ti·thiʹah, E·liphʹe·le·hu, and Mik·neʹiah and Oʹbed-eʹdom and Je·iʹel the gatekeepers.
15-19|1 Chronicles|The singers Heʹman, Aʹsaph, and Eʹthan were to play the copper cymbals;
15-20|1 Chronicles|and Zech·a·riʹah, Aʹzi·el, She·mirʹa·moth, Je·hiʹel, Unʹni, E·liʹab, Ma·a·seiʹah, and Be·naiʹah played stringed instruments tuned to Alʹa·moth;
15-21|1 Chronicles|and Mat·ti·thiʹah, E·liphʹe·le·hu, Mik·neʹiah, Oʹbed-eʹdom, Je·iʹel, and Az·a·ziʹah played harps tuned to Shemʹi·nith, to act as directors.
15-22|1 Chronicles|Chen·a·niʹah the chief of the Levites supervised the transport, for he was an expert,
15-23|1 Chronicles|and Ber·e·chiʹah and El·kaʹnah were gatekeepers for the Ark.
15-24|1 Chronicles|The priests Sheb·a·niʹah, Joshʹa·phat, Ne·thanʹel, A·maʹsai, Zech·a·riʹah, Be·naiʹah, and E·li·eʹzer loudly sounded the trumpets before the Ark of the true God, and Oʹbed-eʹdom and Je·hiʹah also served as gatekeepers for the Ark.
15-25|1 Chronicles|Then David and the elders of Israel and the chiefs of the thousands were walking along to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah up from the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom with rejoicing.
15-26|1 Chronicles|When the true God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, they sacrificed seven young bulls and seven rams.
15-27|1 Chronicles|David was dressed in a sleeveless coat of fine fabric, as were all the Levites carrying the Ark, the singers, and Chen·a·niʹah the chief of the transport and the singers; David was also wearing a linen ephʹod.
15-28|1 Chronicles|All the Israelites were bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with joyful shouting, with the sound of the horn, with trumpets, with cymbals, playing loudly on stringed instruments and harps.
15-29|1 Chronicles|But when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the City of David, Saul’s daughter Miʹchal looked down through the window and saw King David skipping about and celebrating; and she began to despise him in her heart.
00-01|Obadiah|The vision of O·ba·diʹah: This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says regarding Eʹdom: “We have heard a report from Jehovah, An envoy has been sent among the nations: ‘Rise up, let us prepare for battle against her.’” 
00-02|Obadiah|“Look! I have made you insignificant among the nations; You are utterly despised.
00-03|Obadiah|The presumptuousness of your heart has deceived you, You who reside in the retreats of the crag, Dwelling in the height, saying in your heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the earth?’
00-04|Obadiah|Even if you make your dwelling high like the eagle, Or if you place your nest among the stars, I would bring you down from there,” declares Jehovah.
00-05|Obadiah|“If thieves would come to you, robbers by night, (How utterly you will be destroyed!) Would they not steal only what they wanted? Or if it were grape gatherers who would come to you, Would they not leave some gleanings behind?
00-06|Obadiah|O how Eʹsau has been searched out! How his hidden treasures have been sought after!
00-07|Obadiah|They have driven you to the border. All your allies have deceived you. The men at peace with you have prevailed against you. Those eating bread with you will place a net under you, But you will not discern it.
00-08|Obadiah|In that day,” declares Jehovah, “Will I not destroy the wise ones out of Eʹdom And discernment out of the mountainous region of Eʹsau?
00-09|Obadiah|And your warriors will become terrified, O Teʹman, Because each one in the mountainous region of Eʹsau will be destroyed in the slaughter.
00-10|Obadiah|Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob, Shame will cover you, And you will perish forever.
00-11|Obadiah|On the day when you stood off to the side, On the day when strangers took his army into captivity, When foreigners entered his gate and cast lots over Jerusalem, You acted like one of them.
00-12|Obadiah|You should not gloat over your brother’s day on the day of his misfortune, You should not rejoice over the people of Judah on the day of their perishing, And you should not speak so arrogantly on the day of their distress.
00-13|Obadiah|You should not come into the gate of my people in the day of their disaster, You should not gloat over his calamity in the day of his disaster, And you should not lay your hands on his wealth in the day of his disaster.
00-14|Obadiah|You should not stand at the crossroads to slaughter his escapees, And you should not hand over his survivors in the day of distress.
00-15|Obadiah|For the day of Jehovah against all the nations is near. As you have done, so it will be done to you. The way you treated others will come back on your own head.
00-16|Obadiah|For in the way that you have drunk on my holy mountain, All the nations will keep drinking constantly. They will drink and gulp down, And they will be as though they had never existed.
00-17|Obadiah|But on Mount Zion will be those who escape, And it will be holy; And the house of Jacob will take possession of the things belonging to them.
00-18|Obadiah|The house of Jacob will become a fire, The house of Joseph a flame, And the house of Eʹsau like stubble; They will set them ablaze and consume them, And there will be no survivor of the house of Eʹsau, For Jehovah himself has spoken.
00-19|Obadiah|They will take possession of the Negʹeb and the mountainous region of Eʹsau, Of the She·pheʹlah and the land of the Phi·lisʹtines. They will take possession of the field of Eʹphra·im and the field of Sa·marʹi·a, And Benjamin will take possession of Gilʹe·ad.
00-20|Obadiah|To the exiles of this rampart, To the people of Israel will belong the land of the Caʹnaan·ites as far as Zarʹe·phath. And the exiles of Jerusalem, who were in Se·pharʹad, will possess the cities of the Negʹeb.
00-21|Obadiah|And saviors will go up on Mount Zion To judge the mountainous region of Eʹsau, And the kingship will become Jehovah’s.”
09-01|Judges|In time A·bimʹe·lech the son of Jer·ub·baʹal went to his mother’s brothers in Sheʹchem, and he said to them and to all the family of his grandfather:
09-02|Judges|“Please ask all the leaders of Sheʹchem, ‘Which is better for you, for all 70 sons of Jer·ub·baʹal to rule over you or for one man to rule over you? And remember that I am your own bone and flesh.’”
09-03|Judges|So his mother’s brothers said this in his behalf to all the leaders of Sheʹchem, and their hearts were inclined to follow A·bimʹe·lech, for they said: “He is our own brother.”
09-04|Judges|Then they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the house of Baʹal-beʹrith, and A·bimʹe·lech used it to hire idle and insolent men to accompany him.
09-05|Judges|After that he went to his father’s house at Ophʹrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jer·ub·baʹal, 70 men, on one stone. The only survivor was Joʹtham, the youngest son of Jer·ub·baʹal, because he hid.
09-06|Judges|Then all the leaders of Sheʹchem and all Beth-milʹlo gathered together and made A·bimʹe·lech king, close by the big tree, by the pillar that was in Sheʹchem.
09-07|Judges|When they reported it to Joʹtham, he at once went and stood on the top of Mount Gerʹi·zim and called out in a loud voice to them: “Listen to me, you leaders of Sheʹchem, and then God will listen to you.
09-08|Judges|“Once there were trees that went to anoint a king over them. So they said to the olive tree, ‘Rule over us.’
09-09|Judges|But the olive tree said to them, ‘Must I give up my oil, which they use to glorify God and men, to go and wave over the other trees?’
09-10|Judges|Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-11|Judges|But the fig tree said to them, ‘Must I give up my sweetness and my good fruitage to go and wave over the other trees?’
09-12|Judges|Next the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-13|Judges|The vine replied to them, ‘Must I give up my new wine that makes God and men rejoice to go and wave over the trees?’
09-14|Judges|Finally all the other trees said to the bramble, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-15|Judges|At this the bramble said to the trees, ‘If you are really anointing me as king over you, come and seek refuge under my shadow. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebʹa·non.’
09-16|Judges|“Now have you acted sincerely and honorably in making A·bimʹe·lech king, and have you shown goodness toward Jer·ub·baʹal and his household, and have you treated him as he deserves?
09-17|Judges|When my father fought for you, he risked his life to save you from Midʹi·an’s hand.
09-18|Judges|But today you have risen up against my father’s household and killed his sons, 70 men, on one stone. Then you made A·bimʹe·lech, the son of his slave girl, king over the leaders of Sheʹchem just because he is your brother.
09-19|Judges|Yes, if you are acting sincerely and honorably toward Jer·ub·baʹal and his household this day, rejoice over A·bimʹe·lech and let him also rejoice over you.
09-20|Judges|But if not, may fire come out of A·bimʹe·lech and consume the leaders of Sheʹchem and Beth-milʹlo, and may fire come out of the leaders of Sheʹchem and Beth-milʹlo and consume A·bimʹe·lech.”
09-21|Judges|Then Joʹtham fled and escaped to Beʹer, and he lived there because of his brother A·bimʹe·lech.
09-22|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech ruled over Israel for three years.
09-23|Judges|Then God let hostility develop between A·bimʹe·lech and the leaders of Sheʹchem, and they dealt treacherously with A·bimʹe·lech.
09-24|Judges|This was so that the violence done to the 70 sons of Jer·ub·baʹal might be avenged, so as to place responsibility for their blood on their brother A·bimʹe·lech for killing them and on the leaders of Sheʹchem for helping him to kill his brothers.
09-25|Judges|So the leaders of Sheʹchem set men to ambush him on the mountaintops, and they would rob everyone who passed by them on the road. In time it was reported to A·bimʹe·lech.
09-26|Judges|Then Gaʹal son of Eʹbed and his brothers crossed over into Sheʹchem, and the leaders of Sheʹchem put their trust in him.
09-27|Judges|They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards, trod them out, and held a festival, after which they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and cursed A·bimʹe·lech.
09-28|Judges|Then Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed said: “Who is A·bimʹe·lech, and who is Sheʹchem that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jer·ub·baʹal, and is not Zeʹbul his commissioner? Serve the men of Haʹmor, Sheʹchem’s father! But why should we serve him?
09-29|Judges|If only this people were under my command, I would depose A·bimʹe·lech.” Then he said to A·bimʹe·lech: “Increase your army and come out.”
09-30|Judges|When Zeʹbul the prince of the city heard the words of Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed, his anger blazed.
09-31|Judges|So he secretly sent messengers to A·bimʹe·lech, saying: “Look! Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed and his brothers are now in Sheʹchem, and here they are inciting the city against you.
09-32|Judges|Now come up by night, you and your men, and lie in wait in the field.
09-33|Judges|As soon as the sun rises in the morning, you should get up early and attack the city; and when he and his men come out against you, do whatever you can to defeat him.”
09-34|Judges|So A·bimʹe·lech and all the people with him rose up by night, and in four bands they lay in wait against Sheʹchem.
09-35|Judges|When Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, A·bimʹe·lech and the people with him rose up from the ambush.
09-36|Judges|When Gaʹal saw the people, he said to Zeʹbul: “Look! There are people coming down from the mountaintops.” But Zeʹbul said to him: “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”
09-37|Judges|Gaʹal later said: “Look! People are coming down from the center of the land, and one band is coming by the way of the big tree of Me·onʹe·nim.”
09-38|Judges|Zeʹbul replied to him: “Where now is your boast, ‘Who is A·bimʹe·lech that we should serve him?’ Are these not the people you rejected? Go out now and fight against them.”
09-39|Judges|So Gaʹal went out at the head of the leaders of Sheʹchem and fought against A·bimʹe·lech.
09-40|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech pursued him, and Gaʹal fled from him, and many fell slain as far as the entrance of the city gate.
09-41|Judges|And A·bimʹe·lech continued to dwell in A·ruʹmah, and Zeʹbul drove Gaʹal and his brothers out of Sheʹchem.
09-42|Judges|The next day the people went out into the field, and A·bimʹe·lech was told about it.
09-43|Judges|So he took the people and divided them into three bands and lay in wait in the field. When he saw the people going out of the city, he attacked them and struck them down.
09-44|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech and the bands with him charged forward and took a position at the entrance of the city gate, while two bands attacked all who were in the field, and they struck them down.
09-45|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech fought against the city all that day and captured it. He killed the people in it, and then he pulled the city down and sowed it with salt.
09-46|Judges|When all the leaders of the tower of Sheʹchem heard about this, they immediately went to the vault of the house of El-beʹrith.
09-47|Judges|As soon as it was reported to A·bimʹe·lech that all the leaders of the tower of Sheʹchem had gathered together,
09-48|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech and all the men with him went up Mount Zalʹmon. A·bimʹe·lech took an ax in his hand and cut off a tree branch and lifted it on his shoulder and said to the people with him: “What you saw me do, hurry and do the same!”
09-49|Judges|So all the people also cut off branches and followed A·bimʹe·lech. Then they put the branches against the vault and set the vault on fire. So all the people of the tower of Sheʹchem also died, about 1,000 men and women.
09-50|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech then went to Theʹbez; he camped against Theʹbez and captured it.
09-51|Judges|There was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men and women and all the city leaders fled there. They shut themselves in and climbed onto the roof of the tower.
09-52|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech made his way to the tower and attacked it. He approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire.
09-53|Judges|Then one of the women dropped an upper millstone on A·bimʹe·lech’s head and crushed his skull.
09-54|Judges|He quickly called the attendant bearing his weapons and said to him: “Draw your sword and put me to death, so that they may not say about me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So his attendant ran him through, and he died.
09-55|Judges|When the men of Israel saw that A·bimʹe·lech was dead, they all went back home.
09-56|Judges|Thus God repaid A·bimʹe·lech for the evil that he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers.
09-57|Judges|God also made all the evil of the men of Sheʹchem come back on their own heads. So the curse of Joʹtham the son of Jer·ub·baʹal came upon them.
08-01|Luke|Shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with him,
08-02|Luke|as were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magʹda·lene, from whom seven demons had come out;
08-03|Luke|Jo·anʹna the wife of Chuʹza, Herod’s man in charge; Su·sanʹna; and many other women, who were ministering to them from their belongings.
08-04|Luke|Now when a large crowd had gathered together with those who went to him from city to city, he spoke by means of an illustration:
08-05|Luke|“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some of them fell alongside the road and were trampled on, and the birds of heaven ate them up.
08-06|Luke|Some landed on the rock, and after sprouting, they dried up because they had no moisture.
08-07|Luke|Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with them choked them.
08-08|Luke|But others fell on the good soil, and after sprouting, they produced 100 times more fruit.” As he said these things, he called out: “Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.”
08-09|Luke|But his disciples asked him what this illustration meant.
08-10|Luke|He said: “To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of God, but for the rest it is in illustrations so that, though looking, they may look in vain, and though hearing, they may not get the sense.
08-11|Luke|Now the illustration means this: The seed is the word of God.
08-12|Luke|Those alongside the road are the ones who have heard, and then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved.
08-13|Luke|Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy, but these have no root. They believe for a while, but in a season of testing, they fall away.
08-14|Luke|As for that which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, but by being carried away by anxieties, riches, and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to maturity.
08-15|Luke|As for that on the fine soil, these are the ones who, after hearing the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.
08-16|Luke|“No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light.
08-17|Luke|For there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest, nor anything carefully concealed that will never become known and not come out in the open.
08-18|Luke|Therefore, pay attention to how you listen, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.”
08-19|Luke|Now his mother and brothers came to him, but they were unable to get near him because of the crowd.
08-20|Luke|So it was reported to him: “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
08-21|Luke|In reply he said to them: “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”
08-22|Luke|One day he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them: “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So they set sail.
08-23|Luke|But as they were sailing along, he fell asleep. And a violent windstorm descended on the lake, and their boat began to fill up with water and to be in danger.
08-24|Luke|So they went and woke him up, saying: “Instructor, Instructor, we are about to perish!” With that he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they subsided, and a calm set in.
08-25|Luke|Then he said to them: “Where is your faith?” But they were filled with fear and were astounded, saying to one another: “Who really is this? For he orders even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”
08-26|Luke|And they put in to shore in the region of the Gerʹa·senes, which is on the side opposite Galʹi·lee.
08-27|Luke|As Jesus got out onto land, a demon-possessed man from the city met him. For a considerable time he had not worn clothing, and he was staying, not in a house, but among the tombs.
08-28|Luke|At the sight of Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice, he said: “What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”
08-29|Luke|(For Jesus had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. It had seized him on many occasions, and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the isolated places.)
08-30|Luke|Jesus asked him: “What is your name?” He said: “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.
08-31|Luke|And they kept pleading with him not to order them to go away into the abyss.
08-32|Luke|Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain, so they pleaded with him to permit them to enter into the swine, and he gave them permission.
08-33|Luke|With that the demons came out of the man and went into the swine, and the herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and drowned.
08-34|Luke|But when the herders saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.
08-35|Luke|Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, and they grew fearful.
08-36|Luke|Those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been made well.
08-37|Luke|Then a great number from the surrounding region of the Gerʹa·senes asked Jesus to go away from them, because they were gripped by great fear. Then he went aboard the boat to depart.
08-38|Luke|However, the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging to continue with him, but he sent the man away, saying:
08-39|Luke|“Go back home, and keep on relating what God did for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.
08-40|Luke|When Jesus returned, the crowd received him kindly, for they were all expecting him.
08-41|Luke|But look! a man named Jaʹi·rus came; this man was a presiding officer of the synagogue. And he fell at the feet of Jesus and began to plead with him to come to his house,
08-42|Luke|because his only daughter, who was about 12 years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the crowds pressed in on him.
08-43|Luke|Now there was a woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years, and she had not been able to get a cure from anyone.
08-44|Luke|She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment, and immediately her flow of blood stopped.
08-45|Luke|So Jesus said: “Who touched me?” When they were all denying it, Peter said: “Instructor, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing against you.”
08-46|Luke|But Jesus said: “Someone touched me, for I know that power went out of me.”
08-47|Luke|Seeing that she had not escaped notice, the woman came trembling and fell down before him and declared before all the people why she touched him and how she was healed immediately.
08-48|Luke|But he said to her: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
08-49|Luke|While he was yet speaking, a representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came, saying: “Your daughter has died; do not bother the Teacher any longer.” 50 On hearing this, Jesus answered him: “Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be saved.”
08-51|Luke|When he reached the house, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the girl’s father and mother.
08-52|Luke|But people were all weeping and beating themselves in grief for her. So he said: “Stop weeping, for she did not die but is sleeping.”
08-53|Luke|At this they began to laugh at him scornfully, because they knew she had died.
08-54|Luke|But he took her by the hand and called to her: “Child, get up!”
08-55|Luke|And her spirit returned, and she rose immediately, and he ordered that something be given her to eat.
08-56|Luke|Well, her parents were beside themselves, but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
09-01|Luke|Then he called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.
09-02|Luke|And he sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal,
09-03|Luke|and he said to them: “Carry nothing for the trip, neither staff nor food pouch nor bread nor money; neither have two garments.
09-04|Luke|But wherever you enter into a home, stay there and leave from there.
09-05|Luke|And wherever people do not receive you, on going out of that city, shake the dust off your feet for a witness against them.”
09-06|Luke|Then starting out, they went through the territory from village to village, declaring the good news and performing cures everywhere.
09-07|Luke|Now Herod the district ruler heard about everything that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised up from the dead,
09-08|Luke|but others were saying that E·liʹjah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.
09-09|Luke|Herod said: “John I beheaded. Who, then, is this about whom I am hearing such things?” So he was trying to see him.
09-10|Luke|When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus all they had done. With that he took them along and withdrew privately into a city called Beth·saʹi·da.
09-11|Luke|But the crowds, getting to know it, followed him. And he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the Kingdom of God, and he healed those needing a cure.
09-12|Luke|Then the day was coming to a close. The Twelve now came up and said to him: “Send the crowd away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and provisions, because out here we are in an isolated place.”
09-13|Luke|But he said to them: “You give them something to eat.” They said: “We have nothing more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy food for all these people.”
09-14|Luke|There were, in fact, about 5,000 men. But he said to his disciples: “Have them sit down in groups of about 50 each.”
09-15|Luke|And they did so and had them all sit down.
09-16|Luke|Taking now the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke them up and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
09-17|Luke|So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftovers, 12 baskets of fragments.
09-18|Luke|Later, while he was praying alone, the disciples came to him, and he questioned them, saying: “Who are the crowds saying that I am?”
09-19|Luke|In reply they said: “John the Baptist, but others say E·liʹjah, and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”
09-20|Luke|Then he said to them: “You, though, who do you say I am?” Peter answered: “The Christ of God.”
09-21|Luke|Then in a stern talk to them, he instructed them not to tell this to anybody,
09-22|Luke|but he said: “The Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.”
09-23|Luke|Then he went on to say to all: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and keep following me.
09-24|Luke|For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake is the one who will save it.
09-25|Luke|Really, what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers ruin?
09-26|Luke|For whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels.
09-27|Luke|But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God.”
09-28|Luke|In fact, about eight days after saying these words, he took Peter, John, and James along and climbed up the mountain to pray.
09-29|Luke|And as he was praying, the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became glitteringly white.
09-30|Luke|And look! two men were conversing with him; they were Moses and E·liʹjah.
09-31|Luke|These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure, which he was about to fulfill at Jerusalem.
09-32|Luke|Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
09-33|Luke|And as these were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus: “Instructor, it is fine for us to be here. So let us erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for E·liʹjah.” He did not realize what he was saying.
09-34|Luke|But as he was saying these things, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them. As they entered into the cloud, they became afraid.
09-35|Luke|Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying: “This is my Son, the one who has been chosen. Listen to him.”
09-36|Luke|As the voice spoke, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet and did not report to anyone in those days any of the things they saw.
09-37|Luke|The following day when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
09-38|Luke|And look! a man called out from the crowd, saying: “Teacher, I beg you to take a look at my son, because he is my only one.
09-39|Luke|And look! a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth, and only with difficulty does it leave him after bruising him.
09-40|Luke|I begged your disciples to expel it, but they could not.”
09-41|Luke|In response Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with you and put up with you? Bring your son over here.”
09-42|Luke|But even as he was approaching, the demon hurled him to the ground and violently threw him into a convulsion. However, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
09-43|Luke|And they were all astounded at the majestic power of God. While they were all astonished at all the things he was doing, he said to his disciples:
09-44|Luke|“Listen carefully and remember these words, for the Son of man is going to be betrayed into men’s hands.”
09-45|Luke|But they did not understand what he was saying. In fact, it was concealed from them so that they might not grasp it, and they were afraid to question him about this saying.
09-46|Luke|Then a dispute arose among them about which one of them was the greatest.
09-47|Luke|Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a young child, stood him beside him,
09-48|Luke|and said to them: “Whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me also; and whoever receives me also receives the One who sent me. For the one who conducts himself as a lesser one among all of you is the one who is great.”
09-49|Luke|In response John said: “Instructor, we saw someone expelling demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he is not following with us.”
09-50|Luke|But Jesus said to him: “Do not try to prevent him, for whoever is not against you is for you.”
09-51|Luke|As the days were drawing near for him to be taken up, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.
09-52|Luke|So he sent messengers ahead of him. And they went and entered a village of Sa·marʹi·tans to make preparations for him.
09-53|Luke|But they did not receive him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem.
09-54|Luke|When the disciples James and John saw this, they said: “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them?”
09-55|Luke|But he turned and rebuked them.
09-56|Luke|So they went to a different village.
09-57|Luke|Now as they were going along the road, someone said to him: “I will follow you wherever you go.”
09-58|Luke|But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”
09-59|Luke|Then he said to another: “Be my follower.” The man said: “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”
10-01|Luke|After these things the Lord designated 70 others and sent them out by twos ahead of him into every city and place where he himself was to go.
10-02|Luke|Then he said to them: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.
10-03|Luke|Go! Look! I am sending you out as lambs in among wolves.
10-04|Luke|Do not carry a money bag or a food pouch or sandals, and do not greet anyone along the road.
10-05|Luke|Wherever you enter into a house, say first: ‘May this house have peace.’
10-06|Luke|And if a friend of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if there is not, it will return to you.
10-07|Luke|So stay in that house, eating and drinking the things they provide, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not keep transferring from house to house.
10-08|Luke|“Also, wherever you enter into a city and they receive you, eat what is set before you
10-09|Luke|and cure the sick ones in it and tell them: ‘The Kingdom of God has come near to you.’
10-10|Luke|But wherever you enter into a city and they do not receive you, go out into its main streets and say:
10-11|Luke|‘We wipe off against you even the dust that sticks to our feet from your city. Nevertheless, know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near.’
10-12|Luke|I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodʹom in that day than for that city.
10-13|Luke|“Woe to you, Cho·raʹzin! Woe to you, Beth·saʹi·da! because if the powerful works that have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Siʹdon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
10-14|Luke|Consequently, it will be more endurable for Tyre and Siʹdon in the judgment than for you.
10-15|Luke|And you, Ca·perʹna·um, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to the Grave you will come!
10-16|Luke|“Whoever listens to you listens to me. And whoever disregards you disregards me also. Moreover, whoever disregards me disregards also Him who sent me.”
10-17|Luke|Then the 70 returned with joy, saying: “Lord, even the demons are made subject to us by the use of your name.”
10-18|Luke|At that he said to them: “I see Satan already fallen like lightning from heaven.
10-19|Luke|Look! I have given you the authority to trample underfoot serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing at all will harm you.
10-20|Luke|Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens.”
10-21|Luke|In that very hour he became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children. Yes, O Father, because this is the way you approved.
10-22|Luke|All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”
10-23|Luke|With that he turned to the disciples and told them privately: “Happy are the eyes that see the things you are seeing.
10-24|Luke|For I say to you, many prophets and kings desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them, and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them.”
10-25|Luke|Now look! a man versed in the Law stood up to test him and said: “Teacher, what do I need to do to inherit everlasting life?”
10-26|Luke|He said to him: “What is written in the Law? How do you read?”
10-27|Luke|In answer he said: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself.’”
10-28|Luke|He said to him: “You answered correctly; keep doing this and you will get life.”
10-29|Luke|But wanting to prove himself righteous, the man said to Jesus: “Who really is my neighbor?”
10-30|Luke|In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jerʹi·cho and fell victim to robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went off, leaving him half-dead.
10-31|Luke|Now by coincidence a priest was going down on that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.
10-32|Luke|Likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side.
10-33|Luke|But a certain Sa·marʹi·tan traveling the road came upon him, and at seeing him, he was moved with pity.
10-34|Luke|So he approached him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
10-35|Luke|The next day he took out two de·narʹi·i, gave them to the innkeeper, and said: ‘Take care of him, and whatever you spend besides this, I will repay you when I return.’
10-36|Luke|Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man who fell victim to the robbers?”
10-37|Luke|He said: “The one who acted mercifully toward him.” Jesus then said to him: “Go and do the same yourself.”
10-38|Luke|Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village. Here a woman named Martha received him as a guest in her house.
10-39|Luke|She also had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what he was saying.
10-40|Luke|Martha, on the other hand, was distracted with attending to many duties. So she came to him and said: “Lord, does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things? Tell her to come and help me.”
10-41|Luke|In answer the Lord said to her: “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disturbed about many things.
10-42|Luke|A few things, though, are needed, or just one. For her part, Mary chose the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.”
11-01|Luke|Now he was in a certain place praying, and when he stopped, one of his disciples said to him: “Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”
11-02|Luke|So he said to them: “Whenever you pray, say: ‘Father, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come.
11-03|Luke|Give us each day our bread according to our daily needs.
11-04|Luke|And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is in debt to us; and do not bring us into temptation.’”
11-05|Luke|Then he said to them: “Suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves,
11-06|Luke|because one of my friends has just come to me on a journey and I have nothing to offer him.’
11-07|Luke|But that one replies from inside: ‘Stop bothering me. The door is already locked, and my young children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything.’
11-08|Luke|I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because of being his friend, certainly because of his bold persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.
11-09|Luke|So I say to you, keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you.
11-10|Luke|For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened.
11-11|Luke|Indeed, which father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent instead of a fish?
11-12|Luke|Or if he also asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion?
11-13|Luke|Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!”
11-14|Luke|Later he expelled a speechless demon. After the demon came out, the speechless man spoke, and the crowds were amazed.
11-15|Luke|But some of them said: “He expels the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub, the ruler of the demons.”
11-16|Luke|And others, to test him, began demanding a sign out of heaven from him.
11-17|Luke|Knowing their thinking, he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin, and a house divided against itself falls.
11-18|Luke|In the same way, if Satan is also divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I expel the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub.
11-19|Luke|If I expel the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub, by whom do your sons expel them? This is why they will be your judges.
11-20|Luke|But if it is by means of God’s finger that I expel the demons, the Kingdom of God has really overtaken you.
11-21|Luke|When a strong, well-armed man guards his palace, his belongings remain secure.
11-22|Luke|But when someone stronger than he is comes against him and conquers him, that man takes away all his weapons in which he was trusting, and he divides up the things he took from him.
11-23|Luke|Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
11-24|Luke|“When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through waterless places in search of a resting-place, and after finding none, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I moved.’
11-25|Luke|And on arriving, it finds the house swept clean and adorned.
11-26|Luke|Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and after getting inside, they dwell there. So the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first.”
11-27|Luke|Now as he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd called out to him: “Happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that nursed you!”
11-28|Luke|But he said: “No, rather, happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”
11-29|Luke|When the crowds were massing together, he began to say: “This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Joʹnah.
11-30|Luke|For just as Joʹnah became a sign to the Ninʹe·vites, so will the Son of man be to this generation.
11-31|Luke|The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solʹo·mon. But look! something more than Solʹo·mon is here.
11-32|Luke|The men of Ninʹe·veh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at what Joʹnah preached. But look! something more than Joʹnah is here.
11-33|Luke|After lighting a lamp, a person puts it, not in a hidden place nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.
11-34|Luke|The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is focused, your whole body is also bright; but when it is envious, your body is also dark.
11-35|Luke|Be alert, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness.
11-36|Luke|Therefore, if your whole body is bright with no part of it dark, it will all be as bright as when a lamp gives you light by its rays.”
11-37|Luke|When he had said this, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at the table.
11-38|Luke|However, the Pharisee was surprised at seeing that he did not first wash before the dinner.
11-39|Luke|But the Lord said to him: “Now you Pharisees, you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greediness and wickedness.
11-40|Luke|Unreasonable ones! The one who made the outside made also the inside, did he not?
11-41|Luke|But give as gifts of mercy the things that are from within, and look! everything about you will be clean.
11-42|Luke|But woe to you Pharisees, because you give the tenth of the mint and of the rue and of every other garden herb, but you disregard the justice and the love of God! These things you were under obligation to do, but not to disregard those other things.
11-43|Luke|Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces!
11-44|Luke|Woe to you, because you are as those graves that are not clearly visible, that men walk on and do not know it!”
11-45|Luke|In reply one of those versed in the Law said to him: “Teacher, in saying these things, you insult us also.”
11-46|Luke|Then he said: “Woe also to you who are versed in the Law, because you load men down with loads hard to carry, but you yourselves do not touch the loads with one of your fingers!
11-47|Luke|“Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, but your forefathers killed them!
11-48|Luke|Certainly you are witnesses of the deeds of your forefathers, and yet you approve of them, for they killed the prophets but you are building their tombs.
11-49|Luke|That is why the wisdom of God also said: ‘I will send prophets and apostles to them, and they will kill and persecute some of them,
11-50|Luke|so that the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world may be charged against this generation,
11-51|Luke|from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zech·a·riʹah, who was killed between the altar and the house.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.
11-52|Luke|“Woe to you who are versed in the Law, because you took away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not go in, and you hinder those going in!”
11-53|Luke|So when he went out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to put extreme pressure on him and to ply him with many more questions,
11-54|Luke|lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say.
12-01|Luke|In the meantime, when a crowd of so many thousands had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, he started by saying first to his disciples: “Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
12-02|Luke|But there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not become known.
12-03|Luke|Therefore, whatever you say in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you whisper in private rooms will be preached from the housetops.
12-04|Luke|Moreover, I say to you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more.
12-05|Luke|But I will show you whom to fear: Fear the One who after killing has authority to throw into Ge·henʹna. Yes, I tell you, fear this One.
12-06|Luke|Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value, do they not? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
12-07|Luke|But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.
12-08|Luke|“I say to you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.
12-09|Luke|But whoever disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.
12-10|Luke|And everyone who says a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven.
12-11|Luke|When they bring you in before public assemblies, government officials, and authorities, do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in defense or what you will say,
12-12|Luke|for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you should say.”
12-13|Luke|Then someone in the crowd said to him: “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
12-14|Luke|He said to him: “Man, who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two?”
12-15|Luke|Then he said to them: “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.”
12-16|Luke|With that he told them an illustration, saying: “The land of a rich man produced well.
12-17|Luke|So he began reasoning within himself, ‘What should I do now that I have nowhere to gather my crops?’
12-18|Luke|Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones, and there I will gather all my grain and all my goods,
12-19|Luke|and I will say to myself: “You have many good things stored up for many years; take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.”’
12-20|Luke|But God said to him, ‘Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your life from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?’
12-21|Luke|So it goes with the man who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”
12-22|Luke|Then he said to his disciples: “That is why I say to you, stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or about your bodies as to what you will wear.
12-23|Luke|For the life is worth more than food and the body more than clothing.
12-24|Luke|Consider the ravens: They neither sow seed nor reap; they have neither barn nor storehouse; yet God feeds them. Are you not worth much more than birds?
12-25|Luke|Who of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his life span?
12-26|Luke|If, therefore, you cannot do such a small thing, why be anxious about the remaining things?
12-27|Luke|Consider how the lilies grow: They neither toil nor spin; but I tell you that not even Solʹo·mon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
12-28|Luke|Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation in the field that today exists and tomorrow is cast into an oven, how much more will he clothe you, you with little faith!
12-29|Luke|So stop seeking what you will eat and what you will drink, and stop being in anxious suspense;
12-30|Luke|for all these are the things the nations of the world are eagerly pursuing, but your Father knows you need these things.
12-31|Luke|Instead, keep seeking his Kingdom, and these things will be added to you.
12-32|Luke|“Have no fear, little flock, for your Father has approved of giving you the Kingdom.
12-33|Luke|Sell your belongings and give gifts of mercy. Make money pouches that do not wear out, a never-failing treasure in the heavens, where no thief gets near and no moth consumes.
12-34|Luke|For where your treasure is, there your hearts will be also.
12-35|Luke|“Be dressed and ready and have your lamps burning,
12-36|Luke|and you should be like men waiting for their master to return from the marriage, so when he comes and knocks, they may at once open to him.
12-37|Luke|Happy are those slaves whom the master on coming finds watching! Truly I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come alongside and minister to them.
12-38|Luke|And if he comes in the second watch, even if in the third, and finds them ready, happy are they!
12-39|Luke|But know this, if the householder had known at what hour the thief would come, he would not have let his house be broken into.
12-40|Luke|You also, keep ready, because at an hour that you do not think likely, the Son of man is coming.”
12-41|Luke|Then Peter said: “Lord, are you telling this illustration just to us or also to everyone?”
12-42|Luke|And the Lord said: “Who really is the faithful steward, the discreet one, whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time?
12-43|Luke|Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so!
12-44|Luke|I tell you truthfully, he will appoint him over all his belongings.
12-45|Luke|But if ever that slave should say in his heart, ‘My master delays coming,’ and starts to beat the male and female servants and to eat and drink and get drunk,
12-46|Luke|the master of that slave will come on a day that he is not expecting him and at an hour that he does not know, and he will punish him with the greatest severity and assign him a part with the unfaithful ones.
12-47|Luke|Then that slave who understood the will of his master but did not get ready or do what he asked will be beaten with many strokes.
12-48|Luke|But the one who did not understand and yet did things deserving of strokes will be beaten with few. Indeed, everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded of him, and the one who was put in charge of much will have more than usual demanded of him.
12-49|Luke|“I came to start a fire on the earth, and what more is there for me to wish if it has already been lit?
12-50|Luke|Indeed, I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and how I am distressed until it is finished!
12-51|Luke|Do you think I came to give peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
12-52|Luke|For from now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two and two against three.
12-53|Luke|They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”
12-54|Luke|Then he also said to the crowds: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, at once you say, ‘A storm is coming,’ and it happens.
12-55|Luke|And when you see that a south wind is blowing, you say, ‘There will be a heat wave,’ and it occurs.
12-56|Luke|Hypocrites, you know how to examine the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to examine this particular time?
12-57|Luke|Why do you not judge also for yourselves what is righteous?
12-58|Luke|For example, when you are going with your legal opponent to a ruler, while on the way, get to work to settle the dispute with him so that he may not summon you before the judge, and the judge deliver you to the court officer, and the court officer throw you into prison.
12-59|Luke|I tell you, you will certainly not get out of there until you pay over your last small coin.”
00-01|Philemon|Paul, a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Phi·leʹmon our beloved fellow worker,
00-02|Philemon|and to Apʹphi·a our sister, and to Ar·chipʹpus our fellow soldier, and to the congregation that is in your house:
00-03|Philemon|May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
00-04|Philemon|I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,
00-05|Philemon|as I keep hearing of your faith and the love that you have for the Lord Jesus and for all the holy ones.
00-06|Philemon|I pray that your sharing in the faith may move you to acknowledge every good thing that we have through Christ.
00-07|Philemon|For I received much joy and comfort on hearing of your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother.
00-08|Philemon|For this very reason, though I have great freeness of speech in connection with Christ to order you to do what is proper,
00-09|Philemon|I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love, seeing that I am Paul an older man, yes, now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus.
00-10|Philemon|I am appealing to you for my child, whose father I became while in prison, O·nesʹi·mus.
00-11|Philemon|He was formerly useless to you, but now he is useful to you and to me.
00-12|Philemon|I am sending him back to you, yes him, my very own heart.
00-13|Philemon|I would like to keep him here for myself so that he might take your place in ministering to me during my imprisonment for the sake of the good news.
00-14|Philemon|But I do not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed may be done, not under compulsion, but of your own free will.
00-15|Philemon|Perhaps this is really why he broke away for a short while, so that you may have him back forever,
00-16|Philemon|no longer as a slave, but as more than a slave, as a brother who is beloved, especially so to me, but how much more so to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
00-17|Philemon|So if you consider me a friend, receive him kindly the same way you would me.
00-18|Philemon|Moreover, if he did you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to my account.
00-19|Philemon|I, Paul, am writing with my own hand: I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me even your own self.
00-20|Philemon|Yes, brother, may I receive this assistance from you in connection with the Lord; refresh my heart in connection with Christ.
00-21|Philemon|I am confident that you will comply, so I am writing you, knowing that you will do even more than what I say.
00-22|Philemon|But along with that, also prepare a place for me to stay, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given back to you.
00-23|Philemon|Sending you greetings is Epʹa·phras, my fellow captive in union with Christ Jesus,
00-24|Philemon|also Mark, Ar·is·tarʹchus, Deʹmas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
00-25|Philemon|The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show.
00-01|2 John|The older man to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I truly love, and not only I but also all those who have come to know the truth,
00-02|2 John|because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever.
00-03|2 John|There will be with us undeserved kindness, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, with truth and love.
00-04|2 John|I rejoice very much because I have found some of your children walking in the truth, just as we received commandment from the Father.
00-05|2 John|So now I request you, lady, that we love one another. (I am writing you, not a new commandment, but one that we had from the beginning.)
00-06|2 John|And this is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should go on walking in it.
00-07|2 John|For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those not acknowledging Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
00-08|2 John|Look out for yourselves, so that you do not lose the things we have worked to produce, but that you may obtain a full reward.
00-09|2 John|Everyone who pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God. The one who does remain in this teaching is the one who has both the Father and the Son.
00-10|2 John|If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him.
00-11|2 John|For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.
00-12|2 John|Although I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to come to you and to speak with you face-to-face, so that your joy may be in full measure.
00-13|2 John|The children of your sister, the chosen one, send you their greetings.
00-01|3 John|The older man to Gaʹius, the beloved, whom I truly love.
00-02|3 John|Beloved one, I pray that in all things you continue to prosper and enjoy good health, just as you are now prospering.
00-03|3 John|For I rejoiced very much when brothers came and bore witness about the truth you hold, as you go on walking in the truth.
00-04|3 John|No greater joy do I have than this: that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth.
00-05|3 John|Beloved one, you show your faithfulness in what you do for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you.
00-06|3 John|They have given a witness about your love before the congregation. Please send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
00-07|3 John|For it was in behalf of his name that they went out, not taking anything from the people of the nations.
00-08|3 John|So we are under obligation to show hospitality to such ones, so that we may become fellow workers in the truth.
00-09|3 John|I wrote something to the congregation, but Di·otʹre·phes, who likes to have the first place among them, does not accept anything from us with respect.
00-10|3 John|That is why if I come, I will call attention to the works he is doing in spreading malicious talk about us. Not being content with this, he refuses to welcome the brothers with respect; and those who want to welcome them, he tries to hinder and to throw out of the congregation.
00-11|3 John|Beloved one, do not imitate what is bad, but imitate what is good. The one who does good originates with God. The one who does bad has not seen God.
00-12|3 John|De·meʹtri·us has been well-reported-on by them all and by the truth itself. In fact, we too are bearing witness about him, and you know that the witness we give is true.
00-13|3 John|I had many things to write you, but I do not wish to go on writing you with pen and ink.
00-14|3 John|However, I am hoping to see you soon, and we will speak face-to-face. May you have peace. The friends send you their greetings. Give my greetings to the friends by name.
00-01|Jude|Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, but a brother of James, to the called ones who are loved by God the Father and preserved for Jesus Christ:
00-02|Jude|May mercy and peace and love be increased to you.
00-03|Jude|Beloved ones, although I was making every effort to write you about the salvation we hold in common, I found it necessary to write you to urge you to put up a hard fight for the faith that was once for all time delivered to the holy ones.
00-04|Jude|My reason is that certain men have slipped in among you who were long ago appointed to this judgment by the Scriptures; they are ungodly men who turn the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for brazen conduct and who prove false to our only owner and Lord, Jesus Christ.
00-05|Jude|Although you are fully aware of all of this, I want to remind you that Jehovah, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those not showing faith.
00-06|Jude|And the angels who did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place, he has reserved with eternal bonds in dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.
00-07|Jude|In the same manner, Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and the cities around them also gave themselves over to gross sexual immorality and pursued unnatural fleshly desires; they are placed before us as a warning example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.
00-08|Jude|Despite this, these men too are indulging in dreams, defiling the flesh, despising authority, and speaking abusively of glorious ones.
00-09|Jude|But when Miʹcha·el the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses’ body, he did not dare to bring a judgment against him in abusive terms, but said: “May Jehovah rebuke you.”
00-10|Jude|But these men are speaking abusively about all the things they really do not understand. And in all the things that they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animals, they go on corrupting themselves.
00-11|Jude|Too bad for them, for they have followed the path of Cain and have rushed into the erroneous course of Baʹlaam for reward, and they have perished in the rebellious talk of Korʹah!
00-12|Jude|These are the rocks hidden below water at your love feasts while they feast with you, shepherds who feed themselves without fear; waterless clouds carried here and there by the wind; fruitless trees in late autumn, having died twice and having been uprooted;
00-13|Jude|wild waves of the sea that cast up the foam of their own shame; stars with no set course, for which the blackest darkness stands reserved forever.
00-14|Jude|Yes, the seventh one in line from Adam, Eʹnoch, also prophesied about them when he said: “Look! Jehovah came with his holy myriads
00-15|Jude|to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.”
00-16|Jude|These men are murmurers, complainers about their lot in life, following their own desires, and their mouths make grandiose boasts, while they are flattering others for their own benefit.
00-17|Jude|As for you, beloved ones, call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00-18|Jude|how they used to say to you: “In the last time there will be ridiculers, following their own desires for ungodly things.”
00-19|Jude|These are the ones who cause divisions, animalistic men, not having spirituality.
00-20|Jude|But you, beloved ones, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, and pray with holy spirit,
00-21|Jude|in order to keep yourselves in God’s love, while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view.
00-22|Jude|Also, continue showing mercy to some who have doubts;
00-23|Jude|save them by snatching them out of the fire. But continue showing mercy to others, doing so with fear, while you hate even the garment that has been stained by the flesh.
00-24|Jude|Now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling and to make you stand unblemished in the sight of his glory with great joy,
00-25|Jude|to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity. Amen.
