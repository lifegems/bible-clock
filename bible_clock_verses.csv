01-01|Genesis|In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
01-02|Genesis|Now the earth was formless and desolate, and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep, and God’s active force was moving about over the surface of the waters.
01-03|Genesis|And God said: “Let there be light.” Then there was light.
01-04|Genesis|After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light from the darkness.
01-05|Genesis|God called the light Day, but the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.
01-06|Genesis|Then God said: “Let there be an expanse between the waters, and let there be a division between the waters and the waters.”
01-07|Genesis|Then God went on to make the expanse and divided the waters beneath the expanse from the waters above the expanse. And it was so.
01-08|Genesis|God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
01-09|Genesis|Then God said: “Let the waters under the heavens be collected together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.
01-10|Genesis|God called the dry land Earth, but the collecting of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
01-11|Genesis|Then God said: “Let the earth cause grass to sprout, seed-bearing plants and fruit trees according to their kinds, yielding fruit along with seed on the earth.” And it was so.
01-12|Genesis|And the earth began to produce grass, seed-bearing plants and trees yielding fruit along with seed, according to their kinds. Then God saw that it was good.
01-13|Genesis|And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
01-14|Genesis|Then God said: “Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night, and they will serve as signs for seasons and for days and years.
01-15|Genesis|They will serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.” And it was so.
01-16|Genesis|And God went on to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars.
01-17|Genesis|Thus God put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth
01-18|Genesis|and to dominate by day and by night and to make a division between the light and the darkness. Then God saw that it was good.
01-19|Genesis|And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
01-20|Genesis|Then God said: “Let the waters swarm with living creatures, and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”
01-21|Genesis|And God created the great sea creatures and all living creatures that move and swarm in the waters according to their kinds and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
01-22|Genesis|With that God blessed them, saying: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the waters of the sea, and let the flying creatures become many in the earth.”
01-23|Genesis|And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
01-24|Genesis|Then God said: “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds, domestic animals and creeping animals and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.
01-25|Genesis|And God went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds and the domestic animals according to their kinds and all the creeping animals of the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
01-26|Genesis|Then God said: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth.”
01-27|Genesis|And God went on to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.
01-28|Genesis|Further, God blessed them, and God said to them: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.”
01-29|Genesis|Then God said: “Here I have given to you every seed-bearing plant that is on the entire earth and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. Let them serve as food for you.
01-30|Genesis|And to every wild animal of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving on the earth in which there is life, I have given all green vegetation for food.” And it was so.
01-31|Genesis|After that God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
02-01|Genesis|Thus the heavens and the earth and everything in them were completed.
02-02|Genesis|And by the seventh day, God had completed the work that he had been doing, and he began to rest on the seventh day from all his work that he had been doing.
02-03|Genesis|And God went on to bless the seventh day and to declare it sacred, for on it God has been resting from all the work that he has created, all that he purposed to make.
02-04|Genesis|This is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.
02-05|Genesis|No bush of the field was yet on the earth and no vegetation of the field had begun sprouting, because Jehovah God had not made it rain on the earth and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
02-06|Genesis|But a mist would go up from the earth, and it watered the entire surface of the ground.
02-07|Genesis|And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person.
02-08|Genesis|Further, Jehovah God planted a garden in Eʹden, toward the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
02-09|Genesis|Thus Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.
02-10|Genesis|Now there was a river flowing out of Eʹden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four rivers.
02-11|Genesis|The name of the first is Piʹshon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Havʹi·lah, where there is gold.
02-12|Genesis|The gold of that land is good. Bdellium gum and onyx stone are also there.
02-13|Genesis|The name of the second river is Giʹhon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush.
02-14|Genesis|The name of the third river is Hidʹde·kel; it is the one going to the east of As·syrʹi·a. And the fourth river is the Eu·phraʹtes.
02-15|Genesis|Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of Eʹden to cultivate it and to take care of it.
02-16|Genesis|Jehovah God also gave this command to the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction.
02-17|Genesis|But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.”
02-18|Genesis|Then Jehovah God said: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.”
02-19|Genesis|Now Jehovah God had been forming from the ground every wild animal of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call each living creature, that became its name.
02-20|Genesis|So the man named all the domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal of the field, but for man there was no helper as a complement of him.
02-21|Genesis|So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place.
02-22|Genesis|And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.
02-23|Genesis|Then the man said: “This is at last bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, Because from man she was taken.”
02-24|Genesis|That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
02-25|Genesis|And both of them continued to be naked, the man and his wife; yet they were not ashamed.
03-01|Genesis|Now the serpent was the most cautious of all the wild animals of the field that Jehovah God had made. So it said to the woman: “Did God really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?”
03-02|Genesis|At this the woman said to the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.
03-03|Genesis|But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden: ‘You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it; otherwise you will die.’”
03-04|Genesis|At this the serpent said to the woman: “You certainly will not die.
03-05|Genesis|For God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.”
03-06|Genesis|Consequently, the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something desirable to the eyes, yes, the tree was pleasing to look at. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward, she also gave some to her husband when he was with her, and he began eating it.
03-07|Genesis|Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves.
03-08|Genesis|Later they heard the voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden about the breezy part of the day, and the man and his wife hid from the face of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.
03-09|Genesis|And Jehovah God kept calling to the man and saying to him: “Where are you?”
03-10|Genesis|Finally he said: “I heard your voice in the garden, but I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.”
03-11|Genesis|At that he said: “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat?”
03-12|Genesis|The man said: “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate.”
03-13|Genesis|Jehovah God then said to the woman: “What is this you have done?” The woman replied: “The serpent deceived me, so I ate.”
03-14|Genesis|Then Jehovah God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you are the cursed one out of all the domestic animals and out of all the wild animals of the field. On your belly you will go, and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
03-15|Genesis|And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring. He will crush your head, and you will strike him in the heel.”
03-16|Genesis|To the woman he said: “I will greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in pain you will give birth to children, and your longing will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.”
03-17|Genesis|And to Adam he said: “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate from the tree concerning which I gave you this command, ‘You must not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life.
03-18|Genesis|It will grow thorns and thistles for you, and you must eat the vegetation of the field.
03-19|Genesis|In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”
03-20|Genesis|After this Adam named his wife Eve, because she was to become the mother of everyone living.
03-21|Genesis|And Jehovah God made long garments from skins for Adam and for his wife, to clothe them.
03-22|Genesis|Jehovah God then said: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad. Now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever,—”
03-23|Genesis|With that Jehovah God expelled him from the garden of Eʹden to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken. 24 So he drove the man out, and he posted at the east of the garden of Eʹden the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning continuously to guard the way to the tree of life.
04-01|Genesis|Now Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said: “I have produced a male child with the help of Jehovah.”
04-02|Genesis|Later she again gave birth, to his brother Abel. Abel became a shepherd of the flock, but Cain became a cultivator of the ground.
04-03|Genesis|After some time, Cain brought some fruits of the land as an offering to Jehovah.
04-04|Genesis|But Abel brought some firstlings of his flock, including their fat. While Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and on his offering,
04-05|Genesis|he did not look with any favor on Cain and on his offering. So Cain grew hot with anger and was dejected.
04-06|Genesis|Then Jehovah said to Cain: “Why are you so angry and dejected?
04-07|Genesis|If you turn to doing good, will you not be restored to favor? But if you do not turn to doing good, sin is crouching at the door, and its craving is to dominate you; but will you get the mastery over it?”
04-08|Genesis|After that Cain said to his brother Abel: “Let us go over into the field.” So while they were in the field, Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him.
04-09|Genesis|Later on, Jehovah said to Cain: “Where is your brother Abel?” and he said: “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?”
04-10|Genesis|At this He said: “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.
04-11|Genesis|And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
04-12|Genesis|When you cultivate the ground, it will not give you back its produce. You will become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth.”
04-13|Genesis|At this Cain said to Jehovah: “The punishment for my error is too great to bear.
04-14|Genesis|Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your face; and I will become a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and anyone who finds me will certainly kill me.”
04-15|Genesis|So Jehovah said to him: “For that reason, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times.” So Jehovah set up a sign for Cain in order that no one finding him would strike him.
04-16|Genesis|Then Cain went away from before Jehovah and took up residence in the land of Exile, to the east of Eʹden.
04-17|Genesis|Afterward Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Eʹnoch. Then he engaged in building a city and named the city after his son Eʹnoch.
04-18|Genesis|Later Iʹrad was born to Eʹnoch. And Iʹrad became father to Me·huʹja·el, and Me·huʹja·el became father to Me·thuʹsha·el, and Me·thuʹsha·el became father to Laʹmech.
04-19|Genesis|Laʹmech took two wives for himself. The name of the first was Aʹdah, and the name of the second was Zilʹlah.
04-20|Genesis|Aʹdah gave birth to Jaʹbal. He was the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
04-21|Genesis|His brother’s name was Juʹbal. He was the founder of all those who play the harp and the pipe.
04-22|Genesis|Also, Zilʹlah gave birth to Tuʹbal-cain, who forged every sort of tool of copper and iron. And the sister of Tuʹbal-cain was Naʹa·mah.
04-23|Genesis|Then Laʹmech composed these words for his wives Aʹdah and Zilʹlah: “Hear my voice, you wives of Laʹmech; Give ear to my saying: A man I have killed for wounding me, Yes, a young man for striking me.
04-24|Genesis|If 7 times Cain is to be avenged, Then Laʹmech 77 times.”
04-25|Genesis|Adam again had sexual relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth because, as she said, “God has appointed for me another offspring in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.”
04-26|Genesis|There was also born to Seth a son, and he named him Eʹnosh. At that time people began calling on the name of Jehovah.
09-01|Genesis|God went on to bless Noah and his sons and to say to them: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth.
09-02|Genesis|A fear of you and a terror of you will continue upon every living creature of the earth and upon every flying creature of the heavens, upon everything that moves on the ground and upon all the fish of the sea. They are now given into your hand.
09-03|Genesis|Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. Just as I gave you the green vegetation, I give them all to you.
09-04|Genesis|Only flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.
09-05|Genesis|Besides that, I will demand an accounting for your lifeblood. I will demand an accounting from every living creature; and from each man I will demand an accounting for the life of his brother.
09-06|Genesis|Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image He made man.
09-07|Genesis|As for you, be fruitful and become many, and increase abundantly on the earth and multiply.”
09-08|Genesis|Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
09-09|Genesis|“I am now establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you,
09-10|Genesis|and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the living creatures of the earth with you, all those that came out of the ark—every living creature of the earth.
09-11|Genesis|Yes, I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood, and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.”
09-12|Genesis|And God added: “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations.
09-13|Genesis|I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
09-14|Genesis|Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud.
09-15|Genesis|And I will certainly remember my covenant that I made between me and you and every living creature of every kind; and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.
09-16|Genesis|And the rainbow will occur in the cloud, and I will certainly see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind on the earth.”
09-17|Genesis|God repeated to Noah: “This is the sign of the covenant that I establish between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
09-18|Genesis|Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth. Ham later became the father of Caʹnaan.
09-19|Genesis|These three were Noah’s sons, and all the earth’s population came from them and spread abroad.
09-20|Genesis|Now Noah started off as a farmer, and he planted a vineyard.
09-21|Genesis|When he drank of the wine, he became intoxicated, and he uncovered himself inside his tent.
09-22|Genesis|Ham, the father of Caʹnaan, saw his father’s nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside. 
09-23|Genesis|So Shem and Jaʹpheth took a garment and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backward. Thus they covered their father’s nakedness while their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.
09-24|Genesis|When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,
09-25|Genesis|he said: “Cursed be Caʹnaan. Let him become the lowest slave to his brothers.”
09-26|Genesis|And he added: “Praised be Jehovah, the God of Shem, And let Caʹnaan become a slave to him.
09-27|Genesis|Let God grant ample space to Jaʹpheth, And let him reside in the tents of Shem. Let Caʹnaan become a slave to him also.”
09-28|Genesis|Noah continued to live for 350 years after the Flood.
09-29|Genesis|So all the days of Noah amounted to 950 years, and he died.
13-01|Leviticus|Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and Aaron, saying:
13-02|Leviticus|“If a man develops on his skin a swelling, a scab, or a blotch and it could become the disease of leprosy on his skin, he must then be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests.
13-03|Leviticus|The priest will examine the infection on his skin. When the hair in the infection has turned white and the appearance of the infection is deeper than the skin, it is the disease of leprosy. The priest will examine it and declare him unclean.
13-04|Leviticus|But if the blotch on his skin is white and its appearance is not deeper than the skin and the hair has not turned white, the priest will then quarantine the infected person for seven days.
13-05|Leviticus|The priest will then examine him on the seventh day, and if it appears that the infection has stopped and has not spread on the skin, the priest will quarantine him for another seven days.
13-06|Leviticus|“The priest should examine him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest will declare him clean; it was only a scab. The man will then wash his garments and be clean.
13-07|Leviticus|But if the scab has definitely spread on the skin after he appears before the priest to establish his purification, he will then appear again before the priest.
13-08|Leviticus|The priest will examine it, and if the scab has spread in the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is leprosy.
13-09|Leviticus|“If the disease of leprosy develops in a man, he must then be brought to the priest,
13-10|Leviticus|and the priest will examine him. If there is a white swelling on the skin and it has turned the hair white and there is an open sore in the swelling,
13-11|Leviticus|it is chronic leprosy on his skin, and the priest will declare him unclean. He should not quarantine him, for he is unclean.
13-12|Leviticus|Now if the leprosy breaks out all over the skin and the leprosy covers the person with the disease from head to foot, as far as the priest can see,
13-13|Leviticus|and the priest has examined him and sees that the leprosy has covered all his skin, he will then declare the infected person clean. All of it has turned white, and he is clean.
13-14|Leviticus|But whenever an open sore appears in it, he will be unclean.
13-15|Leviticus|When the priest sees the open sore, he will declare him unclean. The open sore is unclean. It is leprosy.
13-16|Leviticus|But if the open sore again turns white, he will then come to the priest.
13-17|Leviticus|The priest will examine him, and if the infection has turned white, the priest will then declare the infected person clean. He is clean.
13-18|Leviticus|“If a person develops a boil on his skin and it heals,
13-19|Leviticus|but in the place of the boil a white swelling or a reddish-white blotch has developed, he must then show himself to the priest.
13-20|Leviticus|The priest will examine it, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy that has broken out in the boil.
13-21|Leviticus|But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin and appears faded, the priest will then quarantine him for seven days.
13-22|Leviticus|And if it has clearly spread on the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is a disease.
13-23|Leviticus|But if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread, it is only the inflammation from the boil, and the priest will declare him clean.
13-24|Leviticus|“Or if someone has a scar from the fire and the raw flesh of the scar becomes a reddish-white blotch or a white one,
13-25|Leviticus|the priest will then examine it. If the hair in the blotch has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the scar, and the priest will declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy.
13-26|Leviticus|But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in the blotch and it is not deeper than the skin and it is faded, the priest will then quarantine him for seven days.
13-27|Leviticus|The priest will examine him on the seventh day, and if it has clearly spread on the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy.
13-28|Leviticus|But if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread over the skin and it is faded, it is only a swelling of the scar, and the priest will declare him clean, because it is an inflammation of the scar.
13-29|Leviticus|“When a man or a woman develops an infection on the head or on the chin,
13-30|Leviticus|the priest will then examine the infection. If it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair is yellow and thin, the priest will then declare such one unclean; it is an infection of the scalp or the beard. It is leprosy of the head or of the chin.
13-31|Leviticus|But if the priest sees that the infection does not appear to be deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest should quarantine the infected person for seven days.
13-32|Leviticus|The priest will examine the infection on the seventh day, and if the infected area has not spread and no yellow hair has developed in it and the appearance of the infected area is not deeper than the skin,
13-33|Leviticus|the person should have himself shaved, but he will not have the infected area shaved. Then the priest will quarantine the infected person for seven days.
13-34|Leviticus|“The priest will again examine the infected area on the seventh day, and if the infection of the scalp and beard has not spread on the skin and it does not appear deeper than the skin, the priest must then declare him clean, and he should wash his garments and be clean.
13-35|Leviticus|But if the infection clearly spreads on the skin after his purification, 36 the priest will examine him, and if the infection has spread on the skin, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair; that person is unclean.
13-37|Leviticus|But if the examination shows that the infection has not spread and black hair has grown on it, the infection has been healed. He is clean, and the priest will declare him clean.
13-38|Leviticus|“If a man or a woman develops blotches on the skin and the blotches are white,
13-39|Leviticus|the priest will examine them. If the skin blotches are faded white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin. That person is clean.
13-40|Leviticus|“If a man loses the hair of his head and becomes bald, he is clean.
13-41|Leviticus|If he loses the hair on the front of his head and becomes bald there, he is clean.
13-42|Leviticus|But if a reddish-white sore develops on the bald part of his scalp or on his forehead, it is leprosy breaking out on his scalp or on his forehead.
13-43|Leviticus|The priest will examine him, and if the swelling from the infection is reddish-white on the bald spot on top of his head or on his forehead and it looks like leprosy on his skin,
13-44|Leviticus|he is a leper. He is unclean, and the priest should declare him unclean because of the disease on his head.
13-45|Leviticus|As for the leper who has the disease, his garments should be torn and his head should be left ungroomed and he should cover over his mustache and call out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’
13-46|Leviticus|He will be unclean the whole time that he has the disease. Since he is unclean, he should live in isolation. His dwelling place will be outside the camp.
13-47|Leviticus|“If the disease of leprosy contaminates a garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment,
13-48|Leviticus|either in the warp or in the woof of the linen or of the wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,
13-49|Leviticus|and the yellowish-green or reddish stain from the disease contaminates the garment, a skin, the warp, the woof, or any article of skin, it is a contamination from leprosy, and it should be shown to the priest.
13-50|Leviticus|The priest will examine the disease, and he must quarantine the disease for seven days.
13-51|Leviticus|When he examines the disease on the seventh day and sees that it has spread in the garment, in the warp, in the woof, or in the skin (regardless of what the skin is used for), the disease is malignant leprosy, and it is unclean.
13-52|Leviticus|He should burn the garment or the warp or the woof in the wool or in the linen or any article of skin in which the disease has developed, for it is malignant leprosy. It should be burned in the fire.
13-53|Leviticus|“But if the priest examines it and the disease has not spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin,
13-54|Leviticus|the priest will then command that they should wash the contaminated item, and he will quarantine it for another seven days.
13-55|Leviticus|The priest will then examine the contaminated item after it has been thoroughly washed. If the appearance of the contamination has not changed, even if the disease has not spread, it is unclean. You should burn it in the fire because it has been eaten away, either from its underside or from its outside.
13-56|Leviticus|“But if the priest has examined it and the contaminated part is faded after it has been thoroughly washed, he will then tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof.
13-57|Leviticus|However, if it still appears in another part of the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, it is spreading, and you should burn any contaminated item in the fire.
13-58|Leviticus|But when the contamination disappears from the garment or the warp or the woof or any article of skin that you wash, it should then be washed a second time, and it will be clean.
13-59|Leviticus|“This is the law of the disease of leprosy in a garment of wool or of linen, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin, for declaring it clean or unclean.”
14-01|Leviticus|Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying:
14-02|Leviticus|“This is to be the law of the leper on the day his purification is established, when he is to be brought to the priest.
14-03|Leviticus|The priest will go outside the camp and examine him. If the leper has been cured of the leprosy,
14-04|Leviticus|the priest will command him to bring two live clean birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop for his cleansing.
14-05|Leviticus|The priest will command that the one bird be killed in an earthenware vessel over running water.
14-06|Leviticus|But he should take the living bird along with the cedarwood, the scarlet material, and the hyssop, and dip them together in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.
14-07|Leviticus|Then he will spatter it seven times on the one cleansing himself from the leprosy and declare him clean, and he will set the living bird free in the open field.
14-08|Leviticus|“The one cleansing himself must wash his garments and shave off all his hair and bathe in water, and he will be clean. Afterward, he may come into the camp, but he will dwell outside his tent for seven days.
14-09|Leviticus|On the seventh day, he should shave off all the hair on his head and his chin and his eyebrows. After he shaves off all his hair, he will wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and he will be clean.
14-10|Leviticus|“On the eighth day, he will take two sound young rams, one sound female lamb in its first year, three tenths of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log measure of oil;
14-11|Leviticus|and the priest who declares him clean will present the man who is cleansing himself, along with the offerings, before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
14-12|Leviticus|The priest will take the one young ram and offer it as a guilt offering together with the log measure of oil, and he will wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah.
14-13|Leviticus|Then he will slaughter the young ram in the place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are usually slaughtered, in a holy place, because, like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest. It is something most holy.
14-14|Leviticus|“Then the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest will put it on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
14-15|Leviticus|And the priest will take some of the log measure of oil and pour it into his own left palm. 16 The priest will then dip his right finger into the oil that is in his left palm and spatter some of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah.
14-17|Leviticus|Then the priest will put some of the remaining oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot over the blood of the guilt offering.
14-18|Leviticus|The priest will put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself, and the priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah.
14-19|Leviticus|“The priest will sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one cleansing himself from his impurity, and afterward he will slaughter the burnt offering.
14-20|Leviticus|And the priest will offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar, and the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be clean.
14-21|Leviticus|“However, if he is poor and does not have enough means, he will then take one young ram as a guilt offering for a wave offering, in order to make atonement for himself, along with one tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, a log measure of oil,
14-22|Leviticus|and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, according to his means. The one will serve as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering.
14-23|Leviticus|On the eighth day, he will bring them for establishing his purification to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah.
14-24|Leviticus|“The priest will take the young ram of the guilt offering and the log measure of oil, and the priest will wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah.
14-25|Leviticus|He will then slaughter the young ram of the guilt offering, and the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
14-26|Leviticus|The priest will pour some of the oil into his own left palm,
14-27|Leviticus|and he will then spatter with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before Jehovah.
14-28|Leviticus|And the priest will put some of the oil that is in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot on the same places that he put the blood of the guilt offering.
14-29|Leviticus|The priest will then put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself, in order to make atonement for him before Jehovah.
14-30|Leviticus|“He will offer up one of the turtledoves or one of the young pigeons, according to his means,
14-31|Leviticus|the one he can afford, as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering along with the grain offering; and the priest will make atonement for the one cleansing himself before Jehovah.
14-32|Leviticus|“This is the law for the one in whom the disease of leprosy was but who does not have the means when establishing his purification.”
14-33|Leviticus|Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:
14-34|Leviticus|“When you come into the land of Caʹnaan, which I am giving you as a possession, and I contaminate a house in your land with the disease of leprosy,
14-35|Leviticus|the one to whom the house belongs should then come and tell the priest, ‘Some kind of contamination has appeared in my house.’
14-36|Leviticus|The priest will give orders to clear out the house before he comes to examine the contamination, in order that he may not declare everything that is in the house unclean; and after that the priest will come in to inspect the house.
14-37|Leviticus|He will examine the affected area, and if the walls of the house are contaminated with yellowish-green or reddish depressions and they appear to be deeper than the wall surface,
14-38|Leviticus|the priest will then go out of the house to the entryway of the house and quarantine the house for seven days.
14-39|Leviticus|“Then the priest will return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the contamination has spread in the walls of the house,
14-40|Leviticus|the priest will then give orders, and the contaminated stones must be torn out and thrown outside the city into an unclean place.
14-41|Leviticus|Then he is to have the inside of the house thoroughly scraped, and the plaster and mortar that is removed should be discarded outside the city in an unclean place.
14-42|Leviticus|They will then insert other stones in the place of the stones they removed, and he should use different mortar and have the house plastered.
14-43|Leviticus|“If, though, the contamination returns and breaks out in the house after the stones were torn out and the house was scraped and replastered,
14-44|Leviticus|the priest will then go in and inspect it. If the contamination has spread in the house, it is malignant leprosy in the house. The house is unclean.
14-45|Leviticus|He will then have the house pulled down—its stones, its timbers, and all the plaster and mortar of the house—and carried outside the city to an unclean place.
14-46|Leviticus|But whoever enters the house any of the days it is quarantined will be unclean until the evening;
14-47|Leviticus|and whoever lies down in the house should wash his garments, and whoever eats in the house should wash his garments.
14-48|Leviticus|“However, if the priest comes and sees that the contamination has not spread in the house after the house was replastered, the priest will then declare the house clean, because the contamination has been healed.
14-49|Leviticus|In order to purify the house from uncleanness, he will take two birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop.
14-50|Leviticus|He is to kill the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
14-51|Leviticus|Then he will take the cedarwood, the hyssop, the scarlet material, and the live bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the running water, and he must spatter it toward the house seven times.
14-52|Leviticus|And he will purify the house from uncleanness with the blood of the bird, the running water, the live bird, the cedarwood, the hyssop, and the scarlet material.
14-53|Leviticus|He will then set the live bird free outside the city in the open field and make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.
14-54|Leviticus|“This is the law respecting any case of leprosy, infection of the scalp or the beard,
14-55|Leviticus|leprosy of the garment or the house,
14-56|Leviticus|and respecting swellings, scabs, and blotches,
14-57|Leviticus|in order to determine when something is unclean and when something is clean. This is the law about leprosy.”
07-01|Numbers|On the day that Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and sanctified it, together with all its furnishings, the altar, and all its utensils. When he had anointed and sanctified these things,
07-02|Numbers|the chieftains of Israel, the heads of their paternal houses, made an offering. These chieftains of the tribes who presided over the registration
07-03|Numbers|brought before Jehovah their offering of six covered wagons and 12 oxen, a wagon for two chieftains and a bull for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle.
07-04|Numbers|Jehovah said to Moses:
07-05|Numbers|“Accept these things from them, as they will be used for the service of the tent of meeting, and you should give them to the Levites, to each one as needed for his duties.”
07-06|Numbers|So Moses accepted the wagons and the cattle and gave them to the Levites.
07-07|Numbers|He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gerʹshon, according to what was needed for their duties;
07-08|Numbers|and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Me·rarʹi, according to what was needed for their duties, under the direction of Ithʹa·mar the son of Aaron the priest.
07-09|Numbers|But he did not give any to the sons of Koʹhath because their duties involved the service of the holy place, and they carried the holy things on their shoulders.
07-10|Numbers|Now the chieftains made their presentation at the inauguration of the altar on the day it was anointed. When the chieftains presented their offering before the altar,
07-11|Numbers|Jehovah said to Moses: “One chieftain each day, on successive days, will present his offering for the inauguration of the altar.”
07-12|Numbers|The one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahʹshon the son of Am·minʹa·dab of the tribe of Judah.
07-13|Numbers|His offering was one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering;
07-14|Numbers|one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense;
07-15|Numbers|one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering;
07-16|Numbers|one young goat for a sin offering;
07-17|Numbers|and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Nahʹshon the son of Am·minʹa·dab.
07-18|Numbers|On the second day, Ne·thanʹel the son of Zuʹar, the chieftain of Isʹsa·char, made a presentation.
07-19|Numbers|He presented as his offering one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering;

07-24|Numbers|On the third day, the chieftain for the sons of Zebʹu·lun, E·liʹab the son of Heʹlon,

07-30|Numbers|On the fourth day, the chieftain for the sons of Reuʹben, E·liʹzur the son of Shedʹe·ur,

15-01|Joshua|The land allotted to the tribe of Judah for their families extended to the boundary of Eʹdom, the wilderness of Zin, to the Negʹeb at its southern end.
15-02|Joshua|Their southern boundary ran from the extremity of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.
15-03|Joshua|And it extended south to the ascent of A·krabʹbim, passed over to Zin, then went up from the south to Kaʹdesh-barʹne·a, over to Hezʹron, up to Adʹdar, and went around toward Karʹka.
15-04|Joshua|Then it passed on to Azʹmon and extended to the Wadi of Egypt, and the boundary ended at the Sea. This was their southern boundary.
15-05|Joshua|The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea up to the end of the Jordan, and the boundary at the northern corner was at the bay of the sea, at the end of the Jordan.
15-06|Joshua|The boundary went up to Beth-hogʹlah and passed over at the north of Beth-arʹa·bah, and the boundary went up to the stone of Boʹhan the son of Reuʹben.
15-07|Joshua|The boundary went up to Deʹbir at the Valley of Aʹchor and turned northward to Gilʹgal, which is in front of the ascent of A·dumʹmim that is south of the wadi, and the boundary passed over to the waters of En-sheʹmesh and ended at En-roʹgel.
15-08|Joshua|The boundary went up to the Valley of the Son of Hinʹnom to the slope of the Jebʹu·site at the south, that is, Jerusalem, and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that faces the Valley of Hinʹnom to the west, which is at the extremity of the Valley of Rephʹa·im to the north.
15-09|Joshua|And the boundary was marked from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Neph·toʹah and extended to the cities of Mount Eʹphron; and the boundary was marked to Baʹal·ah, that is, Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim.
15-10|Joshua|The boundary went around from Baʹal·ah westward to Mount Seʹir and passed over to the slope of Mount Jeʹa·rim at the north, that is, Chesʹa·lon, and it went down to Beth-sheʹmesh and passed over to Timʹnah.
15-11|Joshua|And the boundary extended to the slope of Ekʹron to the north, and the boundary was marked to Shikʹke·ron and passed over to Mount Baʹal·ah and extended to Jabʹne·el, and the boundary ended at the sea.
15-12|Joshua|The western boundary was at the Great Sea and its coast. This was the boundary of the descendants of Judah by their families on all sides.
15-13|Joshua|And to Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh, he gave a share among the descendants of Judah at the order of Jehovah to Joshua, namely, Kirʹi·ath-arʹba (Arʹba was the father of Aʹnak), that is, Hebʹron.
15-14|Joshua|So Caʹleb drove out from there the three sons of Aʹnak: Sheʹshai, A·hiʹman, and Talʹmai, descendants of Aʹnak.
15-15|Joshua|Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Deʹbir. (The name of Deʹbir was previously Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher.)
15-16|Joshua|Caʹleb then said: “To the man who strikes Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achʹsah as a wife.”
15-17|Joshua|And Othʹni·el the son of Keʹnaz, Caʹleb’s brother, captured it. So he gave him his daughter Achʹsah as a wife.
15-18|Joshua|While she was going home, she urged him to ask her father for a field. Then she dismounted from her donkey. Caʹleb asked her: “What do you want?”
15-19|Joshua|She said: “Please grant me a blessing, for you have given me a piece of land in the south; give me also Gulʹloth-maʹim.” So he gave her Upper Gulʹloth and Lower Gulʹloth.
15-20|Joshua|This was the inheritance of the tribe of Judah by their families.
15-21|Joshua|The cities at the extremity of the tribe of Judah toward the boundary of Eʹdom in the south were: Kabʹze·el, Eʹder, Jaʹgur,

15-37|Joshua|Zeʹnan, Ha·dashʹah, Migʹdal-gad,
15-38|Joshua|Diʹle·an, Mizʹpeh, Jokʹthe·el,
15-39|Joshua|Laʹchish, Bozʹkath, Egʹlon,
15-40|Joshua|Cabʹbon, Lahʹmam, Chitʹlish,
15-41|Joshua|Ge·deʹroth, Beth-daʹgon, Naʹa·mah, and Mak·keʹdah—16 cities and their settlements.
15-42|Joshua|Libʹnah, Eʹther, Aʹshan,
15-43|Joshua|Iphʹtah, Ashʹnah, Neʹzib,
15-44|Joshua|Keiʹlah, Achʹzib, and Ma·reʹshah—nine cities and their settlements.
15-45|Joshua|Ekʹron and its dependent towns and its settlements;
15-46|Joshua|from Ekʹron westward, all that is alongside Ashʹdod and their settlements.
15-47|Joshua|Ashʹdod, its dependent towns and its settlements; Gazʹa, its dependent towns and its settlements, down to the Wadi of Egypt, the Great Sea, and the adjacent region.
15-48|Joshua|And in the mountainous region, Shaʹmir, Jatʹtir, Soʹcoh,
15-49|Joshua|Danʹnah, Kirʹi·ath-sanʹnah, that is, Deʹbir,
15-50|Joshua|Aʹnab, Eshʹte·moh, Aʹnim,
15-51|Joshua|Goʹshen, Hoʹlon, and Giʹloh—11 cities and their settlements.
15-52|Joshua|Arab, Duʹmah, Eʹshan,
15-53|Joshua|Jaʹnim, Beth-tapʹpu·ah, A·pheʹkah,

15-58|Joshua|Halʹhul, Beth-zur, Geʹdor,
15-59|Joshua|Maʹa·rath, Beth-aʹnoth, and Elʹte·kon—six cities and their settlements.
19-01|Joshua|Then the second lot came out for Simʹe·on, for the tribe of Simʹe·on by their families. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of Judah.
19-02|Joshua|Their inheritance was Beʹer-sheʹba with Sheʹba, Mo·laʹdah,
19-03|Joshua|Haʹzar-shuʹal, Baʹlah, Eʹzem,
19-04|Joshua|El·toʹlad, Beʹthul, Horʹmah,
19-05|Joshua|Zikʹlag, Beth-marʹca·both, Haʹzar-suʹsah,

19-07|Joshua|Aʹin, Rimʹmon, Eʹther, and Aʹshan—four cities and their settlements;
19-08|Joshua|and all the settlements that were around these cities as far as Baʹal·ath-beʹer, Raʹmah of the south. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simʹe·on by their families.
19-09|Joshua|The inheritance of the descendants of Simʹe·on was taken out of the allotment of Judah, because the share of Judah was too large for them. So the descendants of Simʹe·on received a possession within their inheritance.
19-10|Joshua|Next the third lot came up for the descendants of Zebʹu·lun by their families, and the boundary of their inheritance went as far as Saʹrid. 
19-11|Joshua|Their boundary went up westward to Marʹe·al and reached to Dabʹbe·sheth and then to the valley in front of Jokʹne·am. 
19-12|Joshua|And it went from Saʹrid eastward toward the sunrise, to the border of Chisʹloth-taʹbor and out to Dabʹe·rath and then up to Ja·phiʹa. 
19-13|Joshua|And from there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-heʹpher, to Eth-kaʹzin, and out to Rimʹmon, and it extended to Neʹah. 
19-14|Joshua|And the boundary went around it on the north to Hanʹna·thon, and it ended at the Valley of Iphʹtah-el, 
19-15|Joshua|and Katʹtath, Na·halʹal, Shimʹron, Iʹda·lah, and Bethʹle·hem—12 cities and their settlements. 
19-16|Joshua|This was the inheritance of the descendants of Zebʹu·lun by their families. These were the cities and their settlements.
19-17|Joshua|The fourth lot came out for Isʹsa·char, for the descendants of Isʹsa·char by their families. 
19-18|Joshua|And their boundary was to Jezʹre·el, Che·sulʹloth, Shuʹnem, 
19-19|Joshua|Haphʹa·raʹim, Shiʹon, An·a·haʹrath, 
19-20|Joshua|Rabʹbith, Kishʹi·on, Eʹbez, 
19-21|Joshua|Reʹmeth, En-ganʹnim, En-hadʹdah, and Beth-pazʹzez. 
19-22|Joshua|And the boundary reached to Taʹbor and Sha·ha·zuʹmah and Beth-sheʹmesh, and the end of their border was at the Jordan—16 cities and their settlements. 
19-23|Joshua|This was the inheritance of the tribe of Isʹsa·char by their families, the cities and their settlements.
19-24|Joshua|Then the fifth lot came out for the tribe of Ashʹer by their families. 
19-25|Joshua|And their boundary was Helʹkath, Haʹli, Beʹten, Achʹshaph, 
19-26|Joshua|Al·lamʹme·lech, Aʹmad, and Miʹshal. It reached westward to Carʹmel and to Shiʹhor-libʹnath, 
19-27|Joshua|and it went back toward the east to Beth-daʹgon and reached to Zebʹu·lun and the Valley of Iphʹtah-el to the north, to Beth-eʹmek and Ne·iʹel, and it extended to Caʹbul on the left, 
19-28|Joshua|and to Eʹbron, Reʹhob, Hamʹmon, and Kaʹnah as far as Great Siʹdon. 
19-29|Joshua|And the boundary went back to Raʹmah and as far as the fortified city of Tyre. Then the boundary went back to Hoʹsah, and it ended at the sea in the region of Achʹzib, 
19-30|Joshua|Umʹmah, Aʹphek, and Reʹhob—22 cities and their settlements. 
19-31|Joshua|This was the inheritance of the tribe of Ashʹer by their families. These were the cities and their settlements.
19-32|Joshua|The sixth lot came out for the descendants of Naphʹta·li, for the descendants of Naphʹta·li by their families. 
19-33|Joshua|Their boundary was from Heʹleph, from the big tree in Za·a·nanʹnim, and Adʹa·mi-neʹkeb and Jabʹne·el as far as Lakʹkum; and it ended at the Jordan. 
19-34|Joshua|The boundary went back westward to Azʹnoth-taʹbor and extended from there to Hukʹkok and reached to Zebʹu·lun on the south and to Ashʹer on the west and to Judah at the Jordan toward the east. 
19-35|Joshua|And the fortified cities were Zidʹdim, Zer, Hamʹmath, Rakʹkath, Chinʹne·reth, 
19-36|Joshua|Adʹa·mah, Raʹmah, Haʹzor, 
19-37|Joshua|Keʹdesh, Edʹre·i, En-haʹzor, 
19-38|Joshua|Yiʹron, Migʹdal-el, Hoʹrem, Beth-aʹnath, and Beth-sheʹmesh—19 cities and their settlements. 
19-39|Joshua|This was the inheritance of the tribe of Naphʹta·li by their families, the cities and their settlements.
19-40|Joshua|The seventh lot came out for the tribe of Dan by their families. 
19-41|Joshua|And the border of their inheritance was Zoʹrah, Eshʹta·ol, Ir-sheʹmesh, 
19-42|Joshua|Sha·al·abʹbin, Aiʹja·lon, Ithʹlah, 
19-43|Joshua|Eʹlon, Timʹnah, Ekʹron, 
19-44|Joshua|Elʹte·keh, Gibʹbe·thon, Baʹal·ath, 
19-45|Joshua|Jeʹhud, Benʹe-beʹrak, Gath-rimʹmon, 
19-46|Joshua|Me-jarʹkon, and Rakʹkon, with the border facing Jopʹpa. 
19-47|Joshua|But the territory of Dan was too cramped for them. So they went up and fought against Leʹshem and captured it and struck it with the sword. Then they took possession of it and settled in it, and they changed the name of Leʹshem to Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather. 
19-48|Joshua|This was the inheritance of the tribe of Dan by their families. These were the cities and their settlements.
19-49|Joshua|Thus they finished dividing the land for inheritance by its territories. Then the Israelites gave Joshua the son of Nun an inheritance in their midst. 
19-50|Joshua|At the order of Jehovah they gave him the city he asked for, Timʹnath-seʹrah, in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, and he built up the city and settled in it.
19-51|Joshua|These were the inheritances that El·e·aʹzar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel distributed by lot in Shiʹloh before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished apportioning the land.
15-01|1 Chronicles|And he continued building houses for himself in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the Ark of the true God and pitched a tent for it.
15-02|1 Chronicles|It was then that David said: “No one is to carry the Ark of the true God except the Levites, for Jehovah has chosen them to carry the Ark of Jehovah and to minister to him always.”
15-03|1 Chronicles|Then David congregated all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the Ark of Jehovah up to the place that he had prepared for it.
15-04|1 Chronicles|David gathered the descendants of Aaron and the Levites: 5 from the Koʹhath·ites, U·riʹel the chief and 120 of his brothers;
15-06|1 Chronicles|from the Me·rarʹites, A·saiʹah the chief and 220 of his brothers;
15-07|1 Chronicles|from the Gerʹshom·ites, Joel the chief and 130 of his brothers;
15-08|1 Chronicles|from the descendants of E·li·zaʹphan, She·maiʹah the chief and 200 of his brothers;
15-09|1 Chronicles|from the descendants of Hebʹron, Eʹli·el the chief and 80 of his brothers;
15-10|1 Chronicles|from the descendants of Uzʹzi·el, Am·minʹa·dab the chief and 112 of his brothers.
15-11|1 Chronicles|Furthermore, David called the priests Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar and the Levites U·riʹel, A·saiʹah, Joel, She·maiʹah, Eʹli·el, and Am·minʹa·dab,
15-12|1 Chronicles|and he said to them: “You are the heads of the paternal houses of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, you and your brothers, and bring the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel up to the place that I have prepared for it.
15-13|1 Chronicles|Since you did not carry it the first time, the anger of Jehovah our God broke out against us, because we did not search out the proper procedure.”
15-14|1 Chronicles|So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.
15-15|1 Chronicles|Then the Levites carried the Ark of the true God on their shoulders with the poles, just as Moses had commanded by Jehovah’s word.
15-16|1 Chronicles|David then told the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers to sing out joyfully, accompanied by musical instruments: stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals.
15-17|1 Chronicles|So the Levites appointed Heʹman the son of Joel and, of his brothers, Aʹsaph the son of Ber·e·chiʹah and, of the Me·rarʹites their brothers, Eʹthan the son of Kush·aʹiah.
15-18|1 Chronicles|Together with them were their brothers of the second division, Zech·a·riʹah, Ben, Ja·aʹzi·el, She·mirʹa·moth, Je·hiʹel, Unʹni, E·liʹab, Be·naiʹah, Ma·a·seiʹah, Mat·ti·thiʹah, E·liphʹe·le·hu, and Mik·neʹiah and Oʹbed-eʹdom and Je·iʹel the gatekeepers.
15-19|1 Chronicles|The singers Heʹman, Aʹsaph, and Eʹthan were to play the copper cymbals;
15-20|1 Chronicles|and Zech·a·riʹah, Aʹzi·el, She·mirʹa·moth, Je·hiʹel, Unʹni, E·liʹab, Ma·a·seiʹah, and Be·naiʹah played stringed instruments tuned to Alʹa·moth;
15-21|1 Chronicles|and Mat·ti·thiʹah, E·liphʹe·le·hu, Mik·neʹiah, Oʹbed-eʹdom, Je·iʹel, and Az·a·ziʹah played harps tuned to Shemʹi·nith, to act as directors.
15-22|1 Chronicles|Chen·a·niʹah the chief of the Levites supervised the transport, for he was an expert,
15-23|1 Chronicles|and Ber·e·chiʹah and El·kaʹnah were gatekeepers for the Ark.
15-24|1 Chronicles|The priests Sheb·a·niʹah, Joshʹa·phat, Ne·thanʹel, A·maʹsai, Zech·a·riʹah, Be·naiʹah, and E·li·eʹzer loudly sounded the trumpets before the Ark of the true God, and Oʹbed-eʹdom and Je·hiʹah also served as gatekeepers for the Ark.
15-25|1 Chronicles|Then David and the elders of Israel and the chiefs of the thousands were walking along to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah up from the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom with rejoicing.
15-26|1 Chronicles|When the true God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, they sacrificed seven young bulls and seven rams.
15-27|1 Chronicles|David was dressed in a sleeveless coat of fine fabric, as were all the Levites carrying the Ark, the singers, and Chen·a·niʹah the chief of the transport and the singers; David was also wearing a linen ephʹod.
15-28|1 Chronicles|All the Israelites were bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with joyful shouting, with the sound of the horn, with trumpets, with cymbals, playing loudly on stringed instruments and harps.
15-29|1 Chronicles|But when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the City of David, Saul’s daughter Miʹchal looked down through the window and saw King David skipping about and celebrating; and she began to despise him in her heart.
00-01|Obadiah|The vision of O·ba·diʹah: This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says regarding Eʹdom: “We have heard a report from Jehovah, An envoy has been sent among the nations: ‘Rise up, let us prepare for battle against her.’” 
00-02|Obadiah|“Look! I have made you insignificant among the nations; You are utterly despised.
00-03|Obadiah|The presumptuousness of your heart has deceived you, You who reside in the retreats of the crag, Dwelling in the height, saying in your heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the earth?’
00-04|Obadiah|Even if you make your dwelling high like the eagle, Or if you place your nest among the stars, I would bring you down from there,” declares Jehovah.
00-05|Obadiah|“If thieves would come to you, robbers by night, (How utterly you will be destroyed!) Would they not steal only what they wanted? Or if it were grape gatherers who would come to you, Would they not leave some gleanings behind?
00-06|Obadiah|O how Eʹsau has been searched out! How his hidden treasures have been sought after!
00-07|Obadiah|They have driven you to the border. All your allies have deceived you. The men at peace with you have prevailed against you. Those eating bread with you will place a net under you, But you will not discern it.
00-08|Obadiah|In that day,” declares Jehovah, “Will I not destroy the wise ones out of Eʹdom And discernment out of the mountainous region of Eʹsau?
00-09|Obadiah|And your warriors will become terrified, O Teʹman, Because each one in the mountainous region of Eʹsau will be destroyed in the slaughter.
00-10|Obadiah|Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob, Shame will cover you, And you will perish forever.
00-11|Obadiah|On the day when you stood off to the side, On the day when strangers took his army into captivity, When foreigners entered his gate and cast lots over Jerusalem, You acted like one of them.
00-12|Obadiah|You should not gloat over your brother’s day on the day of his misfortune, You should not rejoice over the people of Judah on the day of their perishing, And you should not speak so arrogantly on the day of their distress.
00-13|Obadiah|You should not come into the gate of my people in the day of their disaster, You should not gloat over his calamity in the day of his disaster, And you should not lay your hands on his wealth in the day of his disaster.
00-14|Obadiah|You should not stand at the crossroads to slaughter his escapees, And you should not hand over his survivors in the day of distress.
00-15|Obadiah|For the day of Jehovah against all the nations is near. As you have done, so it will be done to you. The way you treated others will come back on your own head.
00-16|Obadiah|For in the way that you have drunk on my holy mountain, All the nations will keep drinking constantly. They will drink and gulp down, And they will be as though they had never existed.
00-17|Obadiah|But on Mount Zion will be those who escape, And it will be holy; And the house of Jacob will take possession of the things belonging to them.
00-18|Obadiah|The house of Jacob will become a fire, The house of Joseph a flame, And the house of Eʹsau like stubble; They will set them ablaze and consume them, And there will be no survivor of the house of Eʹsau, For Jehovah himself has spoken.
00-19|Obadiah|They will take possession of the Negʹeb and the mountainous region of Eʹsau, Of the She·pheʹlah and the land of the Phi·lisʹtines. They will take possession of the field of Eʹphra·im and the field of Sa·marʹi·a, And Benjamin will take possession of Gilʹe·ad.
00-20|Obadiah|To the exiles of this rampart, To the people of Israel will belong the land of the Caʹnaan·ites as far as Zarʹe·phath. And the exiles of Jerusalem, who were in Se·pharʹad, will possess the cities of the Negʹeb.
00-21|Obadiah|And saviors will go up on Mount Zion To judge the mountainous region of Eʹsau, And the kingship will become Jehovah’s.”
09-01|Judges|In time A·bimʹe·lech the son of Jer·ub·baʹal went to his mother’s brothers in Sheʹchem, and he said to them and to all the family of his grandfather:
09-02|Judges|“Please ask all the leaders of Sheʹchem, ‘Which is better for you, for all 70 sons of Jer·ub·baʹal to rule over you or for one man to rule over you? And remember that I am your own bone and flesh.’”
09-03|Judges|So his mother’s brothers said this in his behalf to all the leaders of Sheʹchem, and their hearts were inclined to follow A·bimʹe·lech, for they said: “He is our own brother.”
09-04|Judges|Then they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the house of Baʹal-beʹrith, and A·bimʹe·lech used it to hire idle and insolent men to accompany him.
09-05|Judges|After that he went to his father’s house at Ophʹrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jer·ub·baʹal, 70 men, on one stone. The only survivor was Joʹtham, the youngest son of Jer·ub·baʹal, because he hid.
09-06|Judges|Then all the leaders of Sheʹchem and all Beth-milʹlo gathered together and made A·bimʹe·lech king, close by the big tree, by the pillar that was in Sheʹchem.
09-07|Judges|When they reported it to Joʹtham, he at once went and stood on the top of Mount Gerʹi·zim and called out in a loud voice to them: “Listen to me, you leaders of Sheʹchem, and then God will listen to you.
09-08|Judges|“Once there were trees that went to anoint a king over them. So they said to the olive tree, ‘Rule over us.’
09-09|Judges|But the olive tree said to them, ‘Must I give up my oil, which they use to glorify God and men, to go and wave over the other trees?’
09-10|Judges|Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-11|Judges|But the fig tree said to them, ‘Must I give up my sweetness and my good fruitage to go and wave over the other trees?’
09-12|Judges|Next the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-13|Judges|The vine replied to them, ‘Must I give up my new wine that makes God and men rejoice to go and wave over the trees?’
09-14|Judges|Finally all the other trees said to the bramble, ‘Come and rule over us.’
09-15|Judges|At this the bramble said to the trees, ‘If you are really anointing me as king over you, come and seek refuge under my shadow. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebʹa·non.’
09-16|Judges|“Now have you acted sincerely and honorably in making A·bimʹe·lech king, and have you shown goodness toward Jer·ub·baʹal and his household, and have you treated him as he deserves?
09-17|Judges|When my father fought for you, he risked his life to save you from Midʹi·an’s hand.
09-18|Judges|But today you have risen up against my father’s household and killed his sons, 70 men, on one stone. Then you made A·bimʹe·lech, the son of his slave girl, king over the leaders of Sheʹchem just because he is your brother.
09-19|Judges|Yes, if you are acting sincerely and honorably toward Jer·ub·baʹal and his household this day, rejoice over A·bimʹe·lech and let him also rejoice over you.
09-20|Judges|But if not, may fire come out of A·bimʹe·lech and consume the leaders of Sheʹchem and Beth-milʹlo, and may fire come out of the leaders of Sheʹchem and Beth-milʹlo and consume A·bimʹe·lech.”
09-21|Judges|Then Joʹtham fled and escaped to Beʹer, and he lived there because of his brother A·bimʹe·lech.
09-22|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech ruled over Israel for three years.
09-23|Judges|Then God let hostility develop between A·bimʹe·lech and the leaders of Sheʹchem, and they dealt treacherously with A·bimʹe·lech.
09-24|Judges|This was so that the violence done to the 70 sons of Jer·ub·baʹal might be avenged, so as to place responsibility for their blood on their brother A·bimʹe·lech for killing them and on the leaders of Sheʹchem for helping him to kill his brothers.
09-25|Judges|So the leaders of Sheʹchem set men to ambush him on the mountaintops, and they would rob everyone who passed by them on the road. In time it was reported to A·bimʹe·lech.
09-26|Judges|Then Gaʹal son of Eʹbed and his brothers crossed over into Sheʹchem, and the leaders of Sheʹchem put their trust in him.
09-27|Judges|They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards, trod them out, and held a festival, after which they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and cursed A·bimʹe·lech.
09-28|Judges|Then Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed said: “Who is A·bimʹe·lech, and who is Sheʹchem that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jer·ub·baʹal, and is not Zeʹbul his commissioner? Serve the men of Haʹmor, Sheʹchem’s father! But why should we serve him?
09-29|Judges|If only this people were under my command, I would depose A·bimʹe·lech.” Then he said to A·bimʹe·lech: “Increase your army and come out.”
09-30|Judges|When Zeʹbul the prince of the city heard the words of Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed, his anger blazed.
09-31|Judges|So he secretly sent messengers to A·bimʹe·lech, saying: “Look! Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed and his brothers are now in Sheʹchem, and here they are inciting the city against you.
09-32|Judges|Now come up by night, you and your men, and lie in wait in the field.
09-33|Judges|As soon as the sun rises in the morning, you should get up early and attack the city; and when he and his men come out against you, do whatever you can to defeat him.”
09-34|Judges|So A·bimʹe·lech and all the people with him rose up by night, and in four bands they lay in wait against Sheʹchem.
09-35|Judges|When Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, A·bimʹe·lech and the people with him rose up from the ambush.
09-36|Judges|When Gaʹal saw the people, he said to Zeʹbul: “Look! There are people coming down from the mountaintops.” But Zeʹbul said to him: “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”
09-37|Judges|Gaʹal later said: “Look! People are coming down from the center of the land, and one band is coming by the way of the big tree of Me·onʹe·nim.”
09-38|Judges|Zeʹbul replied to him: “Where now is your boast, ‘Who is A·bimʹe·lech that we should serve him?’ Are these not the people you rejected? Go out now and fight against them.”
09-39|Judges|So Gaʹal went out at the head of the leaders of Sheʹchem and fought against A·bimʹe·lech.
09-40|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech pursued him, and Gaʹal fled from him, and many fell slain as far as the entrance of the city gate.
09-41|Judges|And A·bimʹe·lech continued to dwell in A·ruʹmah, and Zeʹbul drove Gaʹal and his brothers out of Sheʹchem.
09-42|Judges|The next day the people went out into the field, and A·bimʹe·lech was told about it.
09-43|Judges|So he took the people and divided them into three bands and lay in wait in the field. When he saw the people going out of the city, he attacked them and struck them down.
09-44|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech and the bands with him charged forward and took a position at the entrance of the city gate, while two bands attacked all who were in the field, and they struck them down.
09-45|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech fought against the city all that day and captured it. He killed the people in it, and then he pulled the city down and sowed it with salt.
09-46|Judges|When all the leaders of the tower of Sheʹchem heard about this, they immediately went to the vault of the house of El-beʹrith.
09-47|Judges|As soon as it was reported to A·bimʹe·lech that all the leaders of the tower of Sheʹchem had gathered together,
09-48|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech and all the men with him went up Mount Zalʹmon. A·bimʹe·lech took an ax in his hand and cut off a tree branch and lifted it on his shoulder and said to the people with him: “What you saw me do, hurry and do the same!”
09-49|Judges|So all the people also cut off branches and followed A·bimʹe·lech. Then they put the branches against the vault and set the vault on fire. So all the people of the tower of Sheʹchem also died, about 1,000 men and women.
09-50|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech then went to Theʹbez; he camped against Theʹbez and captured it.
09-51|Judges|There was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men and women and all the city leaders fled there. They shut themselves in and climbed onto the roof of the tower.
09-52|Judges|A·bimʹe·lech made his way to the tower and attacked it. He approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire.
09-53|Judges|Then one of the women dropped an upper millstone on A·bimʹe·lech’s head and crushed his skull.
09-54|Judges|He quickly called the attendant bearing his weapons and said to him: “Draw your sword and put me to death, so that they may not say about me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So his attendant ran him through, and he died.
09-55|Judges|When the men of Israel saw that A·bimʹe·lech was dead, they all went back home.
09-56|Judges|Thus God repaid A·bimʹe·lech for the evil that he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers.
09-57|Judges|God also made all the evil of the men of Sheʹchem come back on their own heads. So the curse of Joʹtham the son of Jer·ub·baʹal came upon them.
20-01|Judges|Consequently, all the Israelites came out from Dan down to Beʹer-sheʹba and from the land of Gilʹe·ad, and the entire assembly gathered unitedly before Jehovah at Mizʹpah.
20-02|Judges|So the chiefs of the people and all the tribes of Israel took their places in the congregation of God’s people—400,000 foot soldiers armed with swords.
20-03|Judges|The Benʹja·min·ites heard that the men of Israel had gone up to Mizʹpah. Then the men of Israel said: “Tell us, how did this terrible thing happen?”
20-04|Judges|At this the Levite man, the husband of the murdered woman, said in answer: “I came to Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin with my concubine to stay overnight.
20-05|Judges|And the inhabitants of Gibʹe·ah rose up against me and surrounded the house by night. They meant to kill me, but they raped my concubine instead, and she died.
20-06|Judges|So I took my concubine’s body and cut it up and sent the pieces into every part of Israel’s inheritance, because they had committed a shameful and disgraceful act in Israel.
20-07|Judges|Now all you people of Israel, give your advice and counsel here.”
20-08|Judges|Then all the people rose up in unison and said: “Not one of us will go to his tent or return to his house.
20-09|Judges|Now this is what we will do to Gibʹe·ah: We will go up against it by lot.
20-10|Judges|We will take 10 men out of 100 from all the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of 1,000 and 1,000 out of 10,000 to collect provisions for the army, so that they may take action against Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin, in view of the disgraceful act that they committed in Israel.”
20-11|Judges|Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city united as allies.
20-12|Judges|Then the tribes of Israel sent men to all the tribesmen of Benjamin, saying: “What is this terrible thing that has happened among you?
20-13|Judges|Now hand over the worthless men from Gibʹe·ah, so that we may put them to death and clear out what is bad from Israel.” But the Benʹja·min·ites refused to listen to their Israelite brothers.
20-14|Judges|Then the Benʹja·min·ites gathered together out of the cities to Gibʹe·ah to go out to battle against the men of Israel.
20-15|Judges|That day the Benʹja·min·ites mustered from their cities 26,000 men armed with swords, apart from the 700 chosen men of Gibʹe·ah.
20-16|Judges|In this army were 700 chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of these men could sling a stone to within a hairbreadth and would not miss.
20-17|Judges|The men of Israel apart from Benjamin mustered 400,000 men armed with swords, and each one was an experienced warrior.
20-18|Judges|They rose up and went up to Bethʹel to inquire of God. Then the people of Israel said: “Who of us should go up in the lead to the battle against the Benʹja·min·ites?” Jehovah replied: “Judah is to take the lead.”
20-19|Judges|After that the Israelites rose up in the morning and camped against Gibʹe·ah.
20-20|Judges|The men of Israel now went out to battle against Benjamin; they drew up in battle formation against them at Gibʹe·ah.
20-21|Judges|So the Benʹja·min·ites came out from Gibʹe·ah and struck down 22,000 men of Israel on that day.
20-22|Judges|However, the army of the men of Israel showed themselves courageous and again drew up in battle formation in the same place as on the first day.
20-23|Judges|Then the Israelites went up and wept before Jehovah until the evening and inquired of Jehovah: “Should we again go into battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin?” To this Jehovah said: “Go up against them.”
20-24|Judges|So the Israelites drew near to the Benʹja·min·ites on the second day.
20-25|Judges|In turn Benjamin came out from Gibʹe·ah to meet them on the second day and struck down another 18,000 Israelites, all of them armed with swords.
20-26|Judges|At that all the men of Israel went up to Bethʹel. They wept and sat there before Jehovah, and they fasted on that day until the evening and offered up burnt offerings and communion offerings before Jehovah.
20-27|Judges|After that the men of Israel inquired of Jehovah, for the ark of the covenant of the true God was there in those days.
20-28|Judges|Now Phinʹe·has the son of El·e·aʹzar, the son of Aaron, was ministering before it in those days. They asked: “Should we go out yet again to battle against our brothers, the men of Benjamin, or should we stop?” Jehovah replied: “Go up, because tomorrow I will give them into your hand.”
20-29|Judges|Then Israel set men in ambush all around Gibʹe·ah.
20-30|Judges|The Israelites went up against the Benʹja·min·ites on the third day, and they drew up in formation against Gibʹe·ah the same as at the other times.
20-31|Judges|When the Benʹja·min·ites went out to meet the army, they were drawn away from the city. Then, as at the other times, they started to attack and kill some of the men on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethʹel and the other to Gibʹe·ah, leaving about 30 men of Israel dead in the open field.
20-32|Judges|So the Benʹja·min·ites said: “They are suffering defeat before us the same as before.” But the Israelites said: “We will retreat and draw them away from the city onto the highways.”
20-33|Judges|So all the men of Israel rose up from their places and drew up in formation at Baʹal-taʹmar while the Israelite ambush charged out of their places in the vicinity of Gibʹe·ah.
20-34|Judges|Thus 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel came in front of Gibʹe·ah, and the fighting was heavy. But the Benʹja·min·ites did not know that disaster was near at hand.
20-35|Judges|Jehovah defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 men in Benjamin, all of them armed with swords.
20-36|Judges|However, the Benʹja·min·ites imagined that the men of Israel would be defeated when they retreated from Benjamin, but they retreated because they trusted in the ambush that was set against Gibʹe·ah.
20-37|Judges|The ambush acted quickly and charged toward Gibʹe·ah. Then the ambush spread out and struck down the whole city with the sword.
20-38|Judges|Now the men of Israel had arranged that the men who ambushed the city would make a smoke signal go up from there.
20-39|Judges|When the Israelites turned around in the battle, the men of Benjamin started by attacking and killing about 30 men of Israel, and they said: “They are clearly suffering another defeat before us, just as in the previous battle.”
20-40|Judges|But the signal started to go up from the city as a pillar of smoke. When the men of Benjamin turned to look, they saw the whole city going up in flames to the sky.
20-41|Judges|Then the men of Israel made an about-face, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster had overtaken them.
20-42|Judges|So they retreated from the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle followed them; the men coming out of the cities joined in striking them down.
20-43|Judges|They surrounded the Benʹja·min·ites and pursued them relentlessly. They trampled them down directly in front of Gibʹe·ah toward the east.
20-44|Judges|Finally 18,000 men of Benjamin fell, all mighty warriors.
20-45|Judges|The men of Benjamin turned and fled into the wilderness to the crag of Rimʹmon, and the Israelites killed 5,000 of them on the highways, and they kept pursuing them as far as Giʹdom; so they struck down 2,000 more men.
20-46|Judges|All those of Benjamin who fell on that day amounted to 25,000 men armed with swords, all mighty warriors.
20-47|Judges|But 600 retreated into the wilderness to the crag of Rimʹmon, and they stayed on the crag of Rimʹmon for four months.
20-48|Judges|And the men of Israel turned back against the Benʹja·min·ites and struck those of the city with the sword, from men to livestock, all that remained. Also, they set all the cities in their path on fire.
17-01|1 Samuel|And the Phi·lisʹtines assembled their armies for war. They assembled at Soʹcoh, which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Soʹcoh and A·zeʹkah, in Eʹphes-damʹmim.
17-02|1 Samuel|Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the Valley of Eʹlah, and they drew up in battle formation to meet the Phi·lisʹtines.
17-03|1 Samuel|The Phi·lisʹtines occupied the mountain on one side, and the Israelites occupied the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.
17-04|1 Samuel|Then a champion came out from the camps of the Phi·lisʹtines; his name was Go·liʹath, from Gath, and his height was six cubits and a span.
17-05|1 Samuel|He had a helmet of copper on his head, and he was wearing a coat of mail of overlapping scales. The weight of the copper coat of mail was 5,000 shekels.
17-06|1 Samuel|He had shin guards of copper on his legs and a javelin of copper slung between his shoulders.
17-07|1 Samuel|The wooden shaft of his spear was like the beam of loom workers, and the iron blade of his spear weighed 600 shekels; and his shield-bearer was marching ahead of him.
17-08|1 Samuel|Then he stood and called out to the battle line of Israel and said to them: “Why have you come out to draw up in battle formation? Am I not the Phi·lisʹtine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
17-09|1 Samuel|If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, we will then become your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, you will become our servants and serve us.”
17-10|1 Samuel|The Phi·lisʹtine then said: “I do taunt the battle line of Israel this day. Give me a man, and let us fight it out!”
17-11|1 Samuel|When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Phi·lisʹtine, they became terrified and greatly afraid.
17-12|1 Samuel|Now David was the son of the Ephʹrath·ite from Bethʹle·hem of Judah named Jesʹse, who had eight sons and who in the days of Saul was already an old man.
17-13|1 Samuel|The three oldest sons of Jesʹse had followed Saul to the war. The names of his three sons who went to war were E·liʹab the firstborn, his second son A·binʹa·dab, and the third Shamʹmah.
17-14|1 Samuel|David was the youngest, and the three oldest followed Saul.
17-15|1 Samuel|David was going back and forth from Saul to tend the sheep of his father at Bethʹle·hem.
17-16|1 Samuel|Meanwhile, the Phi·lisʹtine would come forward and take his position each morning and each evening for 40 days.
17-17|1 Samuel|Then Jesʹse said to his son David: “Take, please, this eʹphah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and carry them quickly to your brothers in the camp.
17-18|1 Samuel|And take these ten portions of cheese to the chief of the thousand; also, you should check on the welfare of your brothers and bring back some token from them.”
17-19|1 Samuel|They were with Saul and all the other men of Israel in the Valley of Eʹlah, fighting against the Phi·lisʹtines.
17-20|1 Samuel|So David got up early in the morning and left someone in charge of the sheep; then he packed up and went just as Jesʹse had commanded him. When he came to the camp enclosure, the army was going out to the battle line, shouting a battle cry.
17-21|1 Samuel|Israel and the Phi·lisʹtines drew up so that one battle line faced the other battle line.
17-22|1 Samuel|David immediately left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he began asking about the welfare of his brothers.
17-23|1 Samuel|While he was speaking with them, there came the champion named Go·liʹath, the Phi·lisʹtine from Gath. He came out from the battle line of the Phi·lisʹtines, and he spoke the same words as before, and David heard him.
17-24|1 Samuel|When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him, terrified.
17-25|1 Samuel|The men of Israel were saying: “Have you seen this man who is coming out? He comes to taunt Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who strikes him down, he will give him his own daughter, and he will give the house of his father exemption in Israel.”
17-26|1 Samuel|David began to say to the men who were standing near him: “What will be done for the man who strikes down that Phi·lisʹtine over there and takes away reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Phi·lisʹtine that he should taunt the battle line of the living God?”
17-27|1 Samuel|Then the people told him the same thing as before: “This is what will be done for the man who strikes him down.”
17-28|1 Samuel|When his oldest brother E·liʹab heard him speak to the men, he became angry with David and said: “Why have you come down? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I well know your presumptuousness and the bad intentions of your heart; you came down just to see the battle.”
17-29|1 Samuel|To this David said: “What have I done now? I was only asking a question!”
17-30|1 Samuel|So he turned from him toward someone else and asked the same thing as before, and the people gave him the same reply as before.
17-31|1 Samuel|The words that David had spoken were overheard and reported to Saul. So he sent for him.
17-32|1 Samuel|David said to Saul: “Let no one lose heart because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Phi·lisʹtine.”
17-33|1 Samuel|But Saul said to David: “You are not able to go fight against this Phi·lisʹtine, for you are but a boy, and he has been a soldier from his youth.”
17-34|1 Samuel|David then said to Saul: “Your servant became a shepherd of his father’s flock, and a lion came, also a bear, and each carried off a sheep from the flock.
17-35|1 Samuel|I went out after it and struck it down and rescued it from its mouth. When it rose up against me, I grabbed it by its fur and struck it down and put it to death.
17-36|1 Samuel|Your servant struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Phi·lisʹtine will become like one of them, for he has taunted the battle lines of the living God.”
17-37|1 Samuel|Then David added: “Jehovah, who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear, he is the one who will rescue me from the hand of this Phi·lisʹtine.” At this Saul said to David: “Go, and may Jehovah be with you.”
17-38|1 Samuel|Saul now clothed David with his garments. He put a copper helmet on his head, after which he clothed him with a coat of mail.
17-39|1 Samuel|Then David strapped on his sword over his garments and tried to go but could not, for he was not used to them. David said to Saul: “I am unable to go in these things, for I am not used to them.” So David took them off.
17-40|1 Samuel|He then took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the streambed and placed them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag, and his sling was in his hand. And he began approaching the Phi·lisʹtine.
17-41|1 Samuel|The Phi·lisʹtine came closer and closer to David, and his shield-bearer was ahead of him.
17-42|1 Samuel|When the Phi·lisʹtine looked and saw David, he sneered at him in contempt because he was just a ruddy and handsome boy.
17-43|1 Samuel|So the Phi·lisʹtine said to David: “Am I a dog, so that you are coming against me with sticks?” With that the Phi·lisʹtine cursed David by his gods.
17-44|1 Samuel|The Phi·lisʹtine said to David: “Just come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.”
17-45|1 Samuel|David replied to the Phi·lisʹtine: “You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I am coming against you in the name of Jehovah of armies, the God of the battle line of Israel, whom you have taunted.
17-46|1 Samuel|This very day Jehovah will surrender you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head; and on this day I will give the corpses of the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth; and people of all the earth will know that there is a God in Israel.
17-47|1 Samuel|And all those gathered here will know that it is not with the sword or the spear that Jehovah saves, for the battle belongs to Jehovah, and he will give all of you into our hand.”
17-48|1 Samuel|Then the Phi·lisʹtine rose and drew steadily closer to meet David, but David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Phi·lisʹtine.
17-49|1 Samuel|David thrust his hand into his bag and took a stone from there and slung it. He struck the Phi·lisʹtine in the forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead and he fell facedown on the ground.
17-50|1 Samuel|So David prevailed over the Phi·lisʹtine with a sling and a stone; he struck down the Phi·lisʹtine and put him to death, though there was no sword in David’s hand.
17-51|1 Samuel|David continued running and stood over him. Then he took hold of the Phi·lisʹtine’s sword and pulled it out of its sheath and made sure that he was dead by cutting off his head with it. When the Phi·lisʹtines saw that their mighty one had died, they fled.
17-52|1 Samuel|At that the men of Israel and of Judah rose and broke into shouting and pursued the Phi·lisʹtines all the way from the valley to the gates of Ekʹron, and the slain of the Phi·lisʹtines lay fallen along the road from Shaʹa·raʹim, as far as Gath and Ekʹron.
17-53|1 Samuel|After the Israelites returned from hotly pursuing the Phi·lisʹtines, they pillaged their camps.
17-54|1 Samuel|Then David took the head of the Phi·lisʹtine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put the Phi·lisʹtine’s weapons in his own tent.
17-55|1 Samuel|At the moment that Saul saw David go out to meet the Phi·lisʹtine, he said to Abʹner, the chief of the army: “Whose son is this boy, Abʹner?” Abʹner replied: “As surely as you live, O king, I do not know!”
17-56|1 Samuel|The king said: “Find out whose son the young man is.”
17-57|1 Samuel|So as soon as David returned from striking down the Phi·lisʹtine, Abʹner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Phi·lisʹtine in his hand.
17-58|1 Samuel|Saul now said to him: “Whose son are you, boy?” to which David said: “The son of your servant Jesʹse the Bethʹle·hem·ite.”
08-01|1 Kings|At that time Solʹo·mon congregated the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, the chieftains of the paternal houses of Israel. They came to King Solʹo·mon at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the City of David, that is, Zion.
08-02|1 Kings|All the men of Israel assembled before King Solʹo·mon at the festival in the month of Ethʹa·nim, that is, the seventh month.
08-03|1 Kings|So all the elders of Israel came, and the priests lifted up the Ark.
08-04|1 Kings|They brought up the Ark of Jehovah, the tent of meeting, and all the holy utensils that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up.
08-05|1 Kings|King Solʹo·mon and the entire assembly of Israel, who had been summoned to meet with him, were before the Ark. So many sheep and cattle were being sacrificed that they could not be counted or numbered.
08-06|1 Kings|Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the innermost room of the house, the Most Holy, underneath the wings of the cherubs.
08-07|1 Kings|Thus the wings of the cherubs were spread out over the place of the Ark, so that the cherubs overshadowed the Ark and its poles.
08-08|1 Kings|The poles were so long that the tips of the poles were visible from the Holy in front of the innermost room, but they were not visible from outside. And they are there to this day.
08-09|1 Kings|There was nothing in the Ark but the two stone tablets that Moses placed there at Horʹeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the people of Israel while they were coming out of the land of Egypt.
08-10|1 Kings|When the priests came out from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of Jehovah.
08-11|1 Kings|The priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.
08-12|1 Kings|At that time Solʹo·mon said: “Jehovah said he would reside in the thick gloom.
08-13|1 Kings|I have successfully built a lofty house for you, an established place for you to dwell in forever.”
08-14|1 Kings|Then the king turned around and began to bless all the congregation of Israel while all the congregation of Israel stood.
08-15|1 Kings|He said: “May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, the one who by his own mouth promised my father David, and by his own hand has given fulfillment, saying, 16 ‘From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house for my name to remain there, but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’
08-17|1 Kings|And it was the heart’s desire of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
08-18|1 Kings|But Jehovah said to my father David, ‘It was your heart’s desire to build a house for my name, and you did well to desire this in your heart. 19 However, you will not build the house, but your own son who is to be born to you is the one who will build the house for my name.’
08-20|1 Kings|Jehovah has carried out the promise that he made, for I have succeeded my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as Jehovah promised. I have also built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel
08-21|1 Kings|and have set up a place there for the Ark containing the covenant that Jehovah made with our forefathers when he was bringing them out of the land of Egypt.”
08-22|1 Kings|Then Solʹo·mon stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the congregation of Israel, and he spread his hands out to the heavens,
08-23|1 Kings|and he said: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and showing loyal love to your servants who are walking before you with all their heart.
08-24|1 Kings|You have kept the promise that you made to your servant David my father. You made the promise with your own mouth, and this day you have fulfilled it with your own hand.
08-25|1 Kings|And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, keep the promise you made to your servant David my father when you said: ‘There will never fail to be a man of your line before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons will pay attention to their way by walking before me, just as you have walked before me.’
08-26|1 Kings|And now, O God of Israel, let the promise that you made to your servant David my father prove trustworthy, please.
08-27|1 Kings|“But will God really dwell on the earth? Look! The heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens, cannot contain you; how much less, then, this house that I have built!
08-28|1 Kings|Now pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request for favor, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry for help and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you today.
08-29|1 Kings|May your eyes be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which you said, ‘My name will be there,’ to listen to the prayer that your servant prays toward this place.
08-30|1 Kings|And listen to your servant’s request for favor and to the request by your people Israel that they pray toward this place, and may you hear from your dwelling place in the heavens; yes, may you hear and forgive.
08-31|1 Kings|“When a man sins against his fellow man and is made to take an oath and is brought under liability to the oath, and while under the oath he comes before your altar in this house,
08-32|1 Kings|may you then hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants by pronouncing the wicked one guilty and bringing what he did on his own head, and by pronouncing the righteous one innocent and rewarding him according to his own righteousness.
08-33|1 Kings|“When your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they kept sinning against you, and they return to you and glorify your name and pray and beg you for favor in this house,
08-34|1 Kings|may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land that you gave to their forefathers.
08-35|1 Kings|“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they kept sinning against you, and they pray toward this place and glorify your name and turn back from their sin because you humbled them,
08-36|1 Kings|may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants, of your people Israel, for you will instruct them about the good way in which they should walk; and bring rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance.
08-37|1 Kings|“If a famine occurs in the land, or a pestilence, a scorching blight, mildew, swarming locusts, or voracious locusts; or if their enemy besieges them in any of the cities of the land or if any other sort of plague or disease occurs,
08-38|1 Kings|whatever prayer, whatever request for favor may be made by any man or by all your people Israel (for each one knows the plague of his own heart) when they spread out their hands toward this house,
08-39|1 Kings|then may you hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and may you forgive and take action; and reward each one according to all his ways, for you know his heart (you alone truly know every human heart),
08-40|1 Kings|so that they may fear you all the days they live on the land that you gave to our forefathers.
08-41|1 Kings|“Also concerning the foreigner who is not part of your people Israel and who comes from a distant land because of your name
08-42|1 Kings|(for they will hear about your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm), and he comes and prays toward this house,
08-43|1 Kings|may you then listen from the heavens, your dwelling place, and do all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as your people Israel do, and may know that your name has been called on this house that I have built.
08-44|1 Kings|“If your people go to war against their enemy in the way that you send them, and they pray to Jehovah in the direction of the city that you have chosen and toward the house that I have built for your name,
08-45|1 Kings|then hear from the heavens their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them.
08-46|1 Kings|“If they sin against you (for there is no man who does not sin), and you are furious with them and you abandon them to an enemy, and their captors carry them off captive to the land of the enemy, far or near;
08-47|1 Kings|and they come to their senses in the land where they were carried off captive, and they return to you and beg you for favor in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,’
08-48|1 Kings|and they return to you with all their heart and all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them off captive, and they pray to you in the direction of their land that you gave to their forefathers and of the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
08-49|1 Kings|then hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, their prayer and their request for favor, and execute judgment for them
08-50|1 Kings|and forgive your people who have sinned against you, forgiving all their transgressions they committed against you. You will make them objects of pity before their captors, and they will pity them
08-51|1 Kings|(for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, from inside the iron-smelting furnace).
08-52|1 Kings|May your eyes be opened to your servant’s request for favor and to the request for favor by your people Israel by listening whenever they call to you.
08-53|1 Kings|For you set them apart as your inheritance out of all the peoples of the earth, just as you declared through Moses your servant when you were bringing our forefathers out of Egypt, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”
08-54|1 Kings|And as soon as Solʹo·mon finished offering to Jehovah this entire prayer and request for favor, he rose up from before the altar of Jehovah, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out to the heavens.
08-55|1 Kings|He then stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying:
08-56|1 Kings|“Praised be Jehovah, who has given a resting-place to his people Israel, just as he promised. Not one word of all his good promise that he made through Moses his servant has failed.
08-57|1 Kings|May Jehovah our God be with us just as he was with our forefathers. May he not abandon us nor forsake us.
08-58|1 Kings|May he draw our heart toward himself, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his regulations, and his judgments, which he commanded our forefathers to observe.
08-59|1 Kings|And may these words of mine with which I have begged Jehovah for favor be near to Jehovah our God by day and night, that he may execute judgment for his servant and for his people Israel as each day requires,
18-01|1 Kings|After some time, in the third year, Jehovah’s word came to E·liʹjah, saying: “Go, present yourself to Aʹhab, and I will send rain on the surface of the ground.”
18-02|1 Kings|So E·liʹjah went to present himself to Aʹhab, while the famine was severe in Sa·marʹi·a.
18-03|1 Kings|Meanwhile, Aʹhab called O·ba·diʹah, who was over the household. (Now O·ba·diʹah greatly feared Jehovah,
18-04|1 Kings|and when Jezʹe·bel was doing away with Jehovah’s prophets, O·ba·diʹah took 100 prophets and hid them 50 to a cave, and he supplied them with bread and water.)
18-05|1 Kings|Aʹhab then said to O·ba·diʹah: “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we can find enough grass to keep the horses and mules alive and not have all our animals die.”
18-06|1 Kings|So they divided between themselves the land they were going to pass through. Aʹhab went alone by one way, and O·ba·diʹah went alone by another way.
18-07|1 Kings|As O·ba·diʹah was on his way, E·liʹjah was there to meet him. At once he recognized him and fell facedown and said: “Is this you, my lord E·liʹjah?”
18-08|1 Kings|He replied to him: “It is I. Go and tell your lord: ‘E·liʹjah is here.’”
18-09|1 Kings|But he said: “What sin have I committed that you should hand your servant over to Aʹhab to put me to death?
18-10|1 Kings|As surely as Jehovah your God is living, there is not a nation or a kingdom where my lord has not sent to look for you. After they said, ‘He is not here,’ he made the kingdom and the nation swear that they could not find you.
18-11|1 Kings|Now you are saying, ‘Go and tell your lord: “E·liʹjah is here.”’
18-12|1 Kings|When I depart from you, the spirit of Jehovah will carry you away to a place I will not know, and when I tell Aʹhab and he does not find you, he will surely kill me. Yet, your servant has feared Jehovah from his youth.
18-13|1 Kings|Has my lord not been told what I did when Jezʹe·bel was killing the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid 100 of the prophets of Jehovah by groups of 50 in a cave and kept supplying them bread and water?
18-14|1 Kings|But now you are saying, ‘Go and tell your lord: “E·liʹjah is here.”’ He will certainly kill me.”
18-15|1 Kings|However, E·liʹjah said: “As surely as Jehovah of armies whom I serve is living, today I will present myself to him.”
18-16|1 Kings|So O·ba·diʹah went off to meet Aʹhab and told him, and Aʹhab went to meet E·liʹjah.
18-17|1 Kings|As soon as Aʹhab saw E·liʹjah, he said to him: “Is this you, the one bringing great trouble on Israel?”
18-18|1 Kings|To this he said: “I have not brought trouble on Israel, but you and the house of your father have, by abandoning the commandments of Jehovah and by following the Baʹals.
18-19|1 Kings|And now summon all Israel to me at Mount Carʹmel, as well as the 450 prophets of Baʹal and the 400 prophets of the sacred pole, who are eating at the table of Jezʹe·bel.”
18-20|1 Kings|So Aʹhab sent word among all the people of Israel and collected the prophets together at Mount Carʹmel.
18-21|1 Kings|Then E·liʹjah approached all the people and said: “How long will you be limping between two different opinions? If Jehovah is the true God, follow him; but if Baʹal is, follow him!” But the people did not say a word in answer to him.
18-22|1 Kings|E·liʹjah then said to the people: “I am the only prophet of Jehovah left, while the prophets of Baʹal are 450 men.
18-23|1 Kings|Let them give us two young bulls, and let them choose one young bull and cut it into pieces and put it on the wood, but they should not put fire to it. I will prepare the other young bull, and I will place it on the wood, but I will not put fire to it.
18-24|1 Kings|Then you must call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah. The God who answers by fire will show that he is the true God.” To this all the people answered: “What you say is good.”
18-25|1 Kings|E·liʹjah now said to the prophets of Baʹal: “Choose one young bull and prepare it first, because you are the majority. Then call on the name of your god, but you must not put fire to it.”
18-26|1 Kings|So they took the young bull that was given to them, prepared it, and kept calling on the name of Baʹal from morning until noon, saying: “O Baʹal, answer us!” But there was no voice and no one answering. They kept limping around the altar that they had made.
18-27|1 Kings|About noon E·liʹjah began to mock them and say: “Call out at the top of your voice! After all, he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought or he has gone to relieve himself. Or maybe he is asleep and someone needs to wake him up!”
18-28|1 Kings|They were calling out at the top of their voice and cutting themselves with daggers and lances, according to their custom, until their blood gushed out all over them.
18-29|1 Kings|Noon was past and they continued in a frenzy until the time the evening grain offering is presented, but there was no voice and no one answering; no one was paying attention.
18-30|1 Kings|At length E·liʹjah said to all the people: “Approach me.” So all the people approached him. Then he repaired the altar of Jehovah that had been torn down.
18-31|1 Kings|E·liʹjah then took 12 stones, corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Jehovah’s word had come, saying: “Israel will be your name.”
18-32|1 Kings|With the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah. Then he made a trench all around the altar, an area large enough to sow with two seah measures of seed.
18-33|1 Kings|After that he put the pieces of wood in order, cut the young bull into pieces, and placed it on the wood. He now said: “Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the pieces of wood.”
18-34|1 Kings|Then he said: “Do it again.” So they did it again. Once more he said: “Do it a third time.” So they did it a third time.
18-35|1 Kings|And the water ran all around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.
18-36|1 Kings|About the time when the evening grain offering is presented, E·liʹjah the prophet stepped forward and said: “O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and that it is by your word that I have done all these things.
18-37|1 Kings|Answer me, O Jehovah! Answer me so that this people may know that you, Jehovah, are the true God and that you are turning their hearts back to you.”
18-38|1 Kings|At that the fire of Jehovah fell from above and consumed the burnt offering, the pieces of wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water from the trench.
18-39|1 Kings|When all the people saw it, they immediately fell facedown and said: “Jehovah is the true God! Jehovah is the true God!”
18-40|1 Kings|Then E·liʹjah said to them: “Seize the prophets of Baʹal! Do not let a single one of them escape!” At once they seized them, and E·liʹjah brought them down to the stream of Kiʹshon and slaughtered them there.
18-41|1 Kings|E·liʹjah now said to Aʹhab: “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy downpour.”
18-42|1 Kings|So Aʹhab went up to eat and drink, while E·liʹjah went up to the top of Carʹmel and crouched on the ground, keeping his face between his knees.
18-43|1 Kings|Then he said to his attendant: “Go up, please, and look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked and said: “There is nothing at all.” Seven times E·liʹjah said, “Go back.”
18-44|1 Kings|The seventh time his attendant said: “Look! There is a small cloud like a man’s hand ascending out of the sea.” He now said: “Go, say to Aʹhab, ‘Hitch up the chariot! Go down so that the downpour may not detain you!’”
18-45|1 Kings|Meanwhile, the sky grew dark with clouds, the wind blew, and a heavy downpour fell; and Aʹhab kept riding and made his way to Jezʹre·el.
18-46|1 Kings|But the hand of Jehovah came on E·liʹjah, and he wrapped his garment around his hips and ran ahead of Aʹhab all the way to Jezʹre·el.
19-01|1 Kings|Then Aʹhab told Jezʹe·bel all that E·liʹjah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
19-02|1 Kings|At that Jezʹe·bel sent a messenger to E·liʹjah, saying: “So may the gods do to me and add to it if by this time tomorrow I do not make you like each one of them!”
19-03|1 Kings|At that he became afraid, so he got up and ran for his life. He came to Beʹer-sheʹba, which belongs to Judah, and he left his attendant there.
19-04|1 Kings|He went a day’s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree, and he asked that he might die. He said: “It is enough! Now, O Jehovah, take my life away, for I am no better than my forefathers.”
19-05|1 Kings|Then he lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree. But suddenly an angel touched him and said to him: “Get up and eat.”
19-06|1 Kings|When he looked, there at his head was a round loaf on heated stones and a jug of water. He ate and drank and lay down again.
19-07|1 Kings|Later the angel of Jehovah came back a second time and touched him and said: “Get up and eat, for the journey will be too much for you.”
19-08|1 Kings|So he got up and ate and drank, and in the strength of that nourishment he went on for 40 days and 40 nights until he reached Horʹeb, the mountain of the true God.
19-09|1 Kings|There he entered a cave and spent the night; and look! Jehovah’s word came to him, telling him: “What are you doing here, E·liʹjah?”
19-10|1 Kings|To this he said: “I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, your altars they have torn down, and your prophets they have killed with the sword, and I am the only one left. Now they are seeking to take my life away.” 11 But He said: “Go out and stand on the mountain before Jehovah.” And look! Jehovah was passing by, and a great and strong wind was splitting mountains and breaking crags before Jehovah, but Jehovah was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake.
19-12|1 Kings|After the earthquake, there was a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a calm, low voice.
19-13|1 Kings|As soon as E·liʹjah heard it, he wrapped his face in his official garment and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then a voice asked him: “What are you doing here, E·liʹjah?”
19-14|1 Kings|To this he said: “I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, your altars they have torn down, and your prophets they have killed with the sword, and I am the only one left. Now they are seeking to take my life away.”
19-15|1 Kings|Jehovah said to him: “Return, and go to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, anoint Hazʹa·el as king over Syria.
19-16|1 Kings|And you should anoint Jeʹhu the grandson of Nimʹshi as king over Israel, and you should anoint E·liʹsha the son of Shaʹphat from Aʹbel-me·hoʹlah as prophet to take your place.
19-17|1 Kings|Anyone escaping from Hazʹa·el’s sword, Jeʹhu will put to death; and anyone escaping from Jeʹhu’s sword, E·liʹsha will put to death.
19-18|1 Kings|And I still have left 7,000 in Israel, all whose knees have not bent down to Baʹal and whose mouths have not kissed him.”
19-19|1 Kings|So he went from there and found E·liʹsha the son of Shaʹphat while he was plowing with 12 pairs of bulls ahead of him, and he was with the 12th pair. So E·liʹjah went over to him and threw his official garment on him.
19-20|1 Kings|At that he left the bulls and ran after E·liʹjah and said: “Please, let me kiss my father and my mother. Then I will follow you.” He replied to him: “Go, return, for what have I done to stop you?”
19-21|1 Kings|So he went back and took a pair of bulls and sacrificed them, and he used the plowing gear to boil the meat of the bulls and gave it to the people, and they ate. After that he rose up and followed E·liʹjah and began to minister to him.
20-01|1 Kings|Now King Ben-haʹdad of Syria gathered his whole army together along with 32 other kings and their horses and chariots; he went up and laid siege to Sa·marʹi·a and fought against it.
20-02|1 Kings|Then he sent messengers to King Aʹhab of Israel at the city and said to him: “This is what Ben-haʹdad says,
20-03|1 Kings|‘Your silver and your gold are mine, as well as the best of your wives and your sons.’”
20-04|1 Kings|To this the king of Israel answered: “According to your word, my lord the king, I am yours along with all that belongs to me.”
20-05|1 Kings|The messengers later came back and said: “This is what Ben-haʹdad says, ‘I sent this message to you: “Your silver, your gold, your wives, and your sons you will give me.”
20-06|1 Kings|But about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will carefully search your house and the houses of your servants, and all your desirable things they will seize and take away.’”
20-07|1 Kings|At that the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said: “Take note, please, and see that this man is bent on bringing calamity, for he demanded my wives, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not refuse him.”
20-08|1 Kings|Then all the elders and all the people said to him: “Do not obey, and do not consent.”
20-09|1 Kings|So he said to the messengers of Ben-haʹdad: “Say to my lord the king, ‘All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this I cannot do.’” With that the messengers went off and brought word back to him.
20-10|1 Kings|Ben-haʹdad now sent him this message: “So may the gods do to me and add to it if there is enough dust in Sa·marʹi·a to give each of the people following me a handful!”
20-11|1 Kings|The king of Israel answered: “Tell him, ‘The one who puts on his armor should not boast about himself like one who takes it off.’”
20-12|1 Kings|As soon as he heard this reply, while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, he said to his servants: “Get ready to attack!” So they got ready to attack the city.
20-13|1 Kings|But a prophet approached King Aʹhab of Israel and said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘Have you seen all this large crowd? Here I am giving it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am Jehovah.’”
20-14|1 Kings|Aʹhab asked: “By whom?” to which he said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘By the attendants of the princes of the provinces.’” So he asked: “Who will start the battle?” to which he said: “You!”
20-15|1 Kings|Aʹhab then counted the attendants of the princes of the provinces, and they were 232; after that, he counted all the Israelite men, 7,000.
20-16|1 Kings|They went out at noon while Ben-haʹdad was drinking himself drunk in the tents along with the 32 kings who were helping him.
20-17|1 Kings|When the attendants of the princes of the provinces came out first, Ben-haʹdad at once sent messengers. They reported to him: “Men have come out from Sa·marʹi·a.”
20-18|1 Kings|At that he said: “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for battle, you should still take them alive.”
20-19|1 Kings|But when these came out of the city—the attendants of the princes of the provinces and the armies that were following them—
20-20|1 Kings|each one struck down his opponent. Then the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them, but King Ben-haʹdad of Syria escaped on a horse with some of the horsemen.
20-21|1 Kings|But the king of Israel went out and kept striking down the horses and the chariots, and he inflicted a great defeat on the Syrians.
20-22|1 Kings|Later the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him: “Go, strengthen yourself and consider what you are going to do, for at the start of the next year the king of Syria will come up against you.”
20-23|1 Kings|Now the servants of the king of Syria said to him: “Their God is a God of mountains. That is why they overpowered us. But if we fight against them on level land, we will overpower them.
20-24|1 Kings|Also do this: Remove all the kings from their places, and replace them with governors.
20-25|1 Kings|Then gather an army equal to the army you lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Let us fight against them on level land, and we will surely overpower them.” So he listened to their advice and did just that.
20-26|1 Kings|At the start of the year, Ben-haʹdad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aʹphek for battle against Israel.
20-27|1 Kings|The people of Israel were also mustered and supplied, and they went out to meet them. When the people of Israel camped in front of them, they were like two tiny flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the whole land.
20-28|1 Kings|Then the man of the true God approached the king of Israel and said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘Because the Syrians have said: “Jehovah is a God of mountains, and he is not a God of plains,” I will give all this large crowd into your hand, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.’”
20-29|1 Kings|They remained encamped opposite each other for seven days, and on the seventh day the battle began. The people of Israel struck down 100,000 Syrian foot soldiers in one day.
20-30|1 Kings|And the rest fled to Aʹphek, into the city. But the wall fell down on 27,000 of the men who were left. Ben-haʹdad also fled and came into the city, and he hid in an inner room.
20-31|1 Kings|So his servants said to him: “Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please, let us wear sackcloth on our hips and put ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.”
20-32|1 Kings|So they wore sackcloth around their hips and ropes on their heads and came in to the king of Israel and said: “Your servant Ben-haʹdad says, ‘Please, let me live.’” He replied: “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
20-33|1 Kings|The men took it as an omen and quickly took him at his word, so they said: “Ben-haʹdad is your brother.” At that he said: “Go and get him.” Then Ben-haʹdad went out to him, and he had him get up into the chariot.
20-34|1 Kings|Ben-haʹdad now said to him: “The cities that my father took from your father I will return, and you may establish markets for yourself in Damascus, just as my father did in Sa·marʹi·a.” Aʹhab replied: “On the basis of this agreement, I will let you go.” With that he made an agreement with him and let him go.
20-35|1 Kings|By the word of Jehovah, one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion: “Strike me, please.” But the man refused to strike him.
20-36|1 Kings|So he said to him: “Because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah, as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you.” After he left him, a lion came upon him and killed him.
20-37|1 Kings|He found another man and said: “Strike me, please.” So the man struck him and wounded him.
20-38|1 Kings|Then the prophet went and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
20-39|1 Kings|As the king was passing by, he cried out to the king: “Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and there was a man coming out who brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man. If he is found missing, your life will have to take the place of his life, or else you will pay a talent of silver.’
20-40|1 Kings|And while your servant was busy here and there, suddenly the man was gone.” The king of Israel said to him: “So your own judgment will be; you have decided it yourself.”
20-41|1 Kings|Then he quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets.
20-42|1 Kings|He said to him: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘Because you have let the man whom I said should be destroyed escape from your hand, your life must take the place of his life, and your people the place of his people.’”
20-43|1 Kings|At that the king of Israel went home to Sa·marʹi·a, sullen and dejected.ooked, there at his head was a round loaf on heated stones and a jug of water. He ate and drank and lay down again.

03-01|Lamentations|I am the man who has seen affliction because of the rod of his fury.
03-02|Lamentations|He has driven me out and makes me walk in darkness, not in light.
03-03|Lamentations|Indeed, he repeatedly brings his hand against me all day long.
03-04|Lamentations|He has worn away my flesh and my skin; He has broken my bones.
03-05|Lamentations|He has besieged me; he has surrounded me with bitter poison and hardship.
03-06|Lamentations|He has forced me to sit in dark places, like men who died long ago.
03-07|Lamentations|He has walled me in, so that I cannot escape; He has bound me with heavy copper fetters.
03-08|Lamentations|And when I cry out desperately for help, he rejects my prayer.
03-09|Lamentations|He has blocked up my paths with hewn stones; He has made my roadways crooked.
03-10|Lamentations|He waits to ambush me like a bear, like a lion in hiding.
03-11|Lamentations|He has forced me off the paths and torn me to pieces; He has made me desolate.
03-12|Lamentations|He has bent his bow, and he sets me up as the target for the arrow.
03-13|Lamentations|He has pierced my kidneys with the arrows of his quiver.
03-14|Lamentations|I have become a laughingstock to all the peoples, the theme of their song all day long.
03-15|Lamentations|He has filled me with bitter things and saturated me with wormwood.
03-16|Lamentations|He breaks my teeth with gravel; He makes me cower in the ashes.
03-17|Lamentations|You deprive me of peace; I have forgotten what is good.
03-18|Lamentations|So I say: “My splendor has perished, as well as my expectation in Jehovah.”
03-19|Lamentations|Remember my affliction and my homeless state, the wormwood and the bitter poison.
03-20|Lamentations|You will surely remember and bow low over me.
03-21|Lamentations|I recall this in my heart; that is why I will show a waiting attitude.
03-22|Lamentations|It is because of Jehovah’s loyal love that we have not come to our finish, For his mercies never end.
03-23|Lamentations|They are new each morning; your faithfulness is abundant.
03-24|Lamentations|“Jehovah is my share,” I have said, “that is why I will show a waiting attitude for him.”
03-25|Lamentations|Good is Jehovah to the one hoping in him, to the person who keeps seeking him.
03-26|Lamentations|Good it is to wait in silence for the salvation of Jehovah.
03-27|Lamentations|Good it is for a man to carry the yoke during his youth.
03-28|Lamentations|Let him sit alone and keep silent when He lays it upon him.
03-29|Lamentations|Let him put his mouth in the very dust; there may yet be hope.
03-30|Lamentations|Let him give his cheek to the one striking him; let him have his fill of insults.
03-31|Lamentations|For Jehovah will not cast us off forever.
03-32|Lamentations|Although he has caused grief, he will also show mercy according to his abundant loyal love.
03-33|Lamentations|For it is not in his heart to afflict or grieve the sons of men.
03-34|Lamentations|To crush beneath one’s feet all the prisoners of the earth,
03-35|Lamentations|To deprive a man of justice in the presence of the Most High,
03-36|Lamentations|To defraud a man in his legal case —Jehovah does not tolerate such things.
03-37|Lamentations|Who, then, can speak and have it happen unless Jehovah commands it?
03-38|Lamentations|From the mouth of the Most High, Bad things and good things do not go out together.
03-39|Lamentations|Why should a living person complain about the consequences of his sin?
03-40|Lamentations|Let us examine and scrutinize our ways, and let us return to Jehovah.
03-41|Lamentations|Let us lift up our hearts along with our hands to God in the heavens:
03-42|Lamentations|“We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven.
03-43|Lamentations|With anger you have blocked our approach; You have pursued and killed us without compassion.
03-44|Lamentations|You have blocked approach to yourself with a cloud, so that our prayer may not pass through.
03-45|Lamentations|You make us offscouring and refuse among the peoples.”
03-46|Lamentations|All our enemies open their mouths against us.
03-47|Lamentations|Dread and pitfalls have become our lot, desolation and breakdown.
03-48|Lamentations|Streams of water flow from my eyes over the breakdown of the daughter of my people.
03-49|Lamentations|My eyes weep without ceasing, without pausing,
03-50|Lamentations|Until Jehovah looks down and sees from heaven.
03-51|Lamentations|My eyes have brought me grief because of all the daughters of my city.
03-52|Lamentations|Without cause my enemies have hunted me down like a bird.
03-53|Lamentations|They have silenced my life in the pit; they kept hurling stones at me.
03-54|Lamentations|Waters flowed over my head, and I said: “I am finished!”
03-55|Lamentations|I called out your name, O Jehovah, from the depths of the pit.
03-56|Lamentations|Hear my voice; do not shut your ear to my cry for help, for relief.
03-57|Lamentations|You drew near in the day that I called you. You said: “Do not be afraid.”
03-58|Lamentations|You have defended my cause, O Jehovah, you have redeemed my life.
03-59|Lamentations|You have seen, O Jehovah, the wrong done to me; please grant me justice.
16-01|Ezekiel|The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:
16-02|Ezekiel|“Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her detestable practices.
16-03|Ezekiel|You must say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Caʹnaan·ite. Your father was an Amʹor·ite, and your mother was a Hitʹtite.
16-04|Ezekiel|As for your birth, on the day you were born, your umbilical cord was not cut, you were not washed in water to make you clean, you were not rubbed with salt, and you were not wrapped in cloths.
16-05|Ezekiel|No one pitied you enough to do any of these things. No one had compassion for you. Instead, you were thrown into the open field because you were hated on the day you were born.
16-06|Ezekiel|“‘“When I was passing by, I saw you kicking about in your own blood, and as you lay there in your blood, I said: ‘Keep living!’ Yes, I said to you lying there in your blood: ‘Keep living!’
16-07|Ezekiel|I made you a very great multitude, like plants sprouting in the field, and you grew up and developed and wore the finest ornaments. Your breasts became firm, and your hair grew; but you were still naked and exposed.”’
16-08|Ezekiel|“‘When I was passing by and saw you, I noticed that you were old enough for expressions of love. So I spread my garment over you and covered your nakedness and made an oath and entered into a covenant with you,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘and you became mine.
16-09|Ezekiel|Furthermore, I washed you with water and rinsed away your blood and put oil on you.
16-10|Ezekiel|I then clothed you with an embroidered garment and gave you fine leather sandals and wrapped you in fine linen, and I clothed you with costly garments.
16-11|Ezekiel|I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck.
16-12|Ezekiel|I also put a ring in your nose and earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
16-13|Ezekiel|You kept adorning yourself with gold and silver, and your clothing was fine linen, costly material, and an embroidered garment. Fine flour, honey, and oil were what you ate, and you grew to be extremely beautiful, and you became fit to be a queen.’”
16-14|Ezekiel|“‘Your fame began to spread among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect because my own splendor I placed upon you,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”
16-15|Ezekiel|“‘But you began to trust in your beauty, and you became a prostitute because of your fame. You lavished your acts of prostitution on everyone passing by, and your beauty became his.
16-16|Ezekiel|You took some of your garments and made colorful high places where you prostituted yourself—such things should not take place, nor should they ever happen.
16-17|Ezekiel|You also took your beautiful jewelry made from the gold and silver that I had given to you and you made for yourself male images and prostituted yourself with them.
16-18|Ezekiel|And you took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you offered them my oil and my incense.
16-19|Ezekiel|And the bread that I had given to you—made from fine flour, oil, and honey that I gave you to eat—you also offered to them as a pleasing aroma. That is exactly what happened,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”
16-20|Ezekiel|“‘You took your sons and your daughters whom you had borne to me, and you sacrificed these to idols to be devoured—have your acts of prostitution not gone far enough?
16-21|Ezekiel|You slaughtered my sons, and you offered them as sacrifices by making them pass through the fire.
16-22|Ezekiel|While engaging in all your detestable practices and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth when you were naked and exposed, kicking about in your own blood.
16-23|Ezekiel|After all your evil, woe, woe to you,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.
16-24|Ezekiel|‘You built yourself a mound and made a high place for yourself in every public square.
16-25|Ezekiel|You built your high places at the most prominent place of every street, and you turned your beauty into something detestable by offering yourself to everyone passing by, and you multiplied your acts of prostitution.
16-26|Ezekiel|You prostituted yourself to the sons of Egypt, your lustful neighbors, and you offended me with your countless acts of prostitution.
16-27|Ezekiel|Now I will bring my hand against you and diminish your food allowance and give you over to the will of the women who hate you, the daughters of the Phi·lisʹtines, who were appalled because of your obscene conduct.
16-28|Ezekiel|“‘Because you could not be satisfied, you then prostituted yourself to the sons of As·syrʹi·a, but after prostituting yourself to them, you still did not find satisfaction.
16-29|Ezekiel|So you increased your prostitution toward the land of traders and toward the Chal·deʹans, but even then you did not find satisfaction.
16-30|Ezekiel|How sick your heart was,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘when you did all these things, behaving like a brazen prostitute!
16-31|Ezekiel|But when you built your mound at the most prominent place of every street and made your high place in every public square, you were not like a prostitute, because you refused any payment.
16-32|Ezekiel|You are an adulterous wife who takes strangers instead of her own husband!
16-33|Ezekiel|People give all prostitutes a gift, but you are the one who has given gifts to all those lusting after you, and you bribe them to come to you from all around to commit prostitution.
16-34|Ezekiel|You are the opposite of other women who engage in prostitution. No one commits prostitution your way! You pay others, and they do not pay you. Your way is the opposite.’
16-35|Ezekiel|“Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of Jehovah.
16-36|Ezekiel|This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Because your lust has been poured out and your nakedness has been exposed during your prostitution with your lovers and all your detestable, disgusting idols to which you even sacrificed the blood of your sons,
16-37|Ezekiel|therefore I am collecting together all the lovers you have given pleasure to, all those you loved together with all those you hated. I will collect them together against you from all around and expose your nakedness to them, and they will see you completely naked.
16-38|Ezekiel|“‘And I will punish you with the judgments that adulteresses and women shedding blood deserve, and your blood will be shed in rage and jealousy.
16-39|Ezekiel|I will give you into their hand, and they will tear down your mounds, and your high places will be pulled down; and they will strip you of your garments and take your beautiful jewelry and leave you naked and exposed.
16-40|Ezekiel|They will bring against you a crowd, and they will stone you and will slaughter you with their swords.
16-41|Ezekiel|They will burn your houses with fire and execute judgment on you before the eyes of many women; and I will bring an end to your prostitution, and you will stop giving payment.
16-42|Ezekiel|I will satisfy my rage against you, and my indignation will turn away from you; and I will be calm and no longer feel offended.’
16-43|Ezekiel|“‘Because you did not remember the days of your youth and you have angered me by doing all these things, I will now bring the consequences of your ways on your own head,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘and you will no longer carry on your obscene conduct and all your detestable practices.
16-44|Ezekiel|“‘Look! Everyone who uses proverbs will apply this proverb to you: “Like mother, like daughter!”
16-45|Ezekiel|You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children. And you are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hitʹtite, and your father was an Amʹor·ite.’”
16-46|Ezekiel|“‘Your older sister is Sa·marʹi·a, who is dwelling to the north of you with her daughters, and your younger sister, who is dwelling to the south of you, is Sodʹom with her daughters.
16-47|Ezekiel|Not only did you walk in their ways and follow their detestable practices, but in a short while you were even more corrupt in all your conduct than they were.
16-48|Ezekiel|As surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘Sodʹom your sister and her daughters have not done what you and your daughters have done.
16-49|Ezekiel|Look! This was the error of Sodʹom your sister: She and her daughters were proud and had an abundance of food and carefree tranquillity; yet they did not support the afflicted and the poor.
16-50|Ezekiel|They remained haughty and carried on detestable practices in my sight, so I found it necessary to remove them.
16-51|Ezekiel|“‘Nor did Sa·marʹi·a commit even half as many sins as you did. You kept making your detestable practices abound more than they have, to the point that your sisters appeared righteous because of all your detestable practices.
16-52|Ezekiel|You must now bear your humiliation because you have justified the behavior of your sisters. On account of your sin of acting more detestably than they have, they are more righteous than you. So now, be ashamed and bear the humiliation of making your sisters appear righteous.’
16-53|Ezekiel|“‘And I will gather their captives, the captives of Sodʹom and her daughters and the captives of Sa·marʹi·a and her daughters; I will also gather your captives along with them,
16-54|Ezekiel|so that you may bear your humiliation; and you will feel humiliated because of what you have done by comforting them.
16-55|Ezekiel|Your own sisters, Sodʹom and her daughters, will return to their former state, and Sa·marʹi·a and her daughters will return to their former state, and you along with your own daughters will return to your former state.
16-56|Ezekiel|Sodʹom your sister was not worthy of your mention in the day of your pride,
16-57|Ezekiel|before your own wickedness was exposed. Now the daughters of Syria and her neighbors reproach you, and the daughters of the Phi·lisʹtines, those all around you, treat you with scorn.
16-58|Ezekiel|You will bear the consequences of your obscene conduct and your detestable practices,’ declares Jehovah.”
16-59|Ezekiel|“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘I will now do with you just as you have done, for you despised the oath by breaking my covenant.
05-01|Matthew|When he saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him.
05-02|Matthew|Then he opened his mouth and began teaching them, saying:
05-03|Matthew|“Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.
05-04|Matthew|“Happy are those who mourn, since they will be comforted.
05-05|Matthew|“Happy are the mild-tempered, since they will inherit the earth.
05-06|Matthew|“Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.
05-07|Matthew|“Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.
05-08|Matthew|“Happy are the pure in heart, since they will see God.
05-09|Matthew|“Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.
05-10|Matthew|“Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.
05-11|Matthew|“Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake.
05-12|Matthew|Rejoice and be overjoyed, since your reward is great in the heavens, for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.
05-13|Matthew|“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its strength, how will its saltiness be restored? It is no longer usable for anything except to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.
05-14|Matthew|“You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when located on a mountain.
05-15|Matthew|People light a lamp and set it, not under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house.
05-16|Matthew|Likewise, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.
05-17|Matthew|“Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill.
05-18|Matthew|Truly I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one stroke of a letter to pass away from the Law until all things take place.
05-19|Matthew|Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens.
05-20|Matthew|For I say to you that if your righteousness does not surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens.
05-21|Matthew|“You heard that it was said to those of ancient times: ‘You must not murder, but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.’
05-22|Matthew|However, I say to you that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; and whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Ge·henʹna.
05-23|Matthew|“If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
05-24|Matthew|leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away. First make your peace with your brother, and then come back and offer your gift.
05-25|Matthew|“Be quick to settle matters with your legal opponent, while you are with him on the way there, so that somehow the opponent may not turn you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison.
05-26|Matthew|I say to you for a fact, you will certainly not come out of there until you have paid over your last small coin.
05-27|Matthew|“You heard that it was said: ‘You must not commit adultery.’
05-28|Matthew|But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
05-29|Matthew|If, now, your right eye is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be pitched into Ge·henʹna.
05-30|Matthew|Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to land in Ge·henʹna.
05-31|Matthew|“Moreover, it was said: ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’
05-32|Matthew|However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of sexual immorality, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
05-33|Matthew|“Again you heard that it was said to those of ancient times: ‘You must not swear without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.’
05-34|Matthew|However, I say to you: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne;
05-35|Matthew|nor by earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
05-36|Matthew|Do not swear by your head, since you cannot turn one hair white or black.
05-37|Matthew|Just let your word ‘Yes’ mean yes, your ‘No,’ no, for what goes beyond these is from the wicked one.
05-38|Matthew|“You heard that it was said: ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’
05-39|Matthew|However, I say to you: Do not resist the one who is wicked, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him. 40 And if a person wants to take you to court and get possession of your inner garment, let him also have your outer garment;
05-41|Matthew|and if someone in authority compels you into service for a mile, go with him two miles.
05-42|Matthew|Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from one who wants to borrow from you.
05-43|Matthew|“You heard that it was said: ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
05-44|Matthew|However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you,
05-45|Matthew|so that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.
05-46|Matthew|For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing?
05-47|Matthew|And if you greet your brothers only, what extraordinary thing are you doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing?
05-48|Matthew|You must accordingly be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
21-01|Matthew|When they got close to Jerusalem and arrived at Bethʹpha·ge on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
21-02|Matthew|saying to them: “Go into the village that is within sight, and you will at once find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.
21-03|Matthew|If someone says anything to you, you must say, ‘The Lord needs them.’ At that he will immediately send them.”
21-04|Matthew|This actually took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, who said:
21-05|Matthew|“Tell the daughter of Zion: ‘Look! Your king is coming to you, mild-tempered and mounted on a donkey, yes, on a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.’”
21-06|Matthew|So the disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them.
21-07|Matthew|They brought the donkey and its colt, and they put their outer garments on them, and he sat on them.
21-08|Matthew|Most of the crowd spread their outer garments on the road, while others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.
21-09|Matthew|Moreover, the crowds going ahead of him and those following him kept shouting: “Save, we pray, the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s name! Save him, we pray, in the heights above!”
21-10|Matthew|And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar, saying: “Who is this?”
21-11|Matthew|The crowds kept saying: “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazʹa·reth of Galʹi·lee!”
21-12|Matthew|Jesus entered the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
21-13|Matthew|And he said to them: “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it a cave of robbers.”
21-14|Matthew|Also, blind and lame people came to him in the temple, and he cured them.
21-15|Matthew|When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys who were shouting in the temple, “Save, we pray, the Son of David!” they became indignant
21-16|Matthew|and said to him: “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them: “Yes. Did you never read this, ‘Out of the mouth of children and infants, you have brought forth praise’?”
21-17|Matthew|And leaving them behind, he went out of the city to Bethʹa·ny and spent the night there.
21-18|Matthew|While returning to the city early in the morning, he felt hungry.
21-19|Matthew|He caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it, but he found nothing on it except leaves, and he said to it: “Let no fruit come from you ever again.” And the fig tree withered instantly.
21-20|Matthew|When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said: “How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?”
21-21|Matthew|In answer Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I did to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.
21-22|Matthew|And all the things you ask in prayer, having faith, you will receive.”
21-23|Matthew|After he went into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said: “By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?”
21-24|Matthew|In reply Jesus said to them: “I will also ask you one thing. If you tell me, then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things:
21-25|Matthew|The baptism by John, from what source was it? From heaven or from men?” But they began to reason among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why, then, did you not believe him?’
21-26|Matthew|But if we say, ‘From men,’ we have the crowd to fear, for they all regard John as a prophet.”
21-27|Matthew|So they answered Jesus: “We do not know.” He, in turn, said to them: “Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.
21-28|Matthew|“What do you think? A man had two children. Going up to the first, he said, ‘Child, go work today in the vineyard.’
21-29|Matthew|In answer this one said, ‘I will not,’ but afterward, he felt regret and went out.
21-30|Matthew|Approaching the second, he said the same. This one replied, ‘I will, Sir,’ but did not go out.
21-31|Matthew|Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said: “The first.” Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the Kingdom of God.
21-32|Matthew|For John came to you in a way of righteousness, but you did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him, and even when you saw this, you did not feel regret afterward so as to believe him.
21-33|Matthew|“Hear another illustration: There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower; then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad.
21-34|Matthew|When the fruit season came around, he sent his slaves to the cultivators to collect his fruit.
21-35|Matthew|However, the cultivators took his slaves, and they beat one up, another they killed, another they stoned.
21-36|Matthew|Again he sent other slaves, more than the first group, but they did the same to these.
21-37|Matthew|Lastly he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
21-38|Matthew|On seeing the son, the cultivators said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!’
21-39|Matthew|So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
21-40|Matthew|Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators?”
21-41|Matthew|They said to him: “Because they are evil, he will bring a terrible destruction on them and will lease the vineyard to other cultivators, who will give him the fruits when they become due.”
21-42|Matthew|Jesus said to them: “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone. This has come from Jehovah, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
21-43|Matthew|This is why I say to you, the Kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.
21-44|Matthew|Also, the person falling on this stone will be shattered. As for anyone on whom it falls, it will crush him.”
21-45|Matthew|When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his illustrations, they knew that he was speaking about them.
21-46|Matthew|Although they wanted to seize him, they feared the crowds, because these regarded him as a prophet.
10-01|Mark|From there he got up and came to the borders of Ju·deʹa across the Jordan, and again crowds gathered to him. As he was accustomed to do, he again began teaching them.
10-02|Mark|And Pharisees approached, intent on testing him, and they asked whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife.
10-03|Mark|He answered them: “What did Moses command you?”
10-04|Mark|They said: “Moses allowed the writing of a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her.”
10-05|Mark|But Jesus said to them: “Out of regard for your hard-heartedness, he wrote this commandment for you.
10-06|Mark|However, from the beginning of creation, ‘He made them male and female.
10-07|Mark|For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother,
10-08|Mark|and the two will be one flesh,’ so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.
10-09|Mark|Therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.”
10-10|Mark|When they were again in the house, the disciples began to question him about this.
10-11|Mark|He said to them: “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her,
10-12|Mark|and if ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another, she commits adultery.”
10-13|Mark|People now began bringing him young children for him to touch them, but the disciples reprimanded them.
10-14|Mark|At seeing this, Jesus was indignant and said to them: “Let the young children come to me; do not try to stop them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such ones.
10-15|Mark|Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it.”
10-16|Mark|And he took the children into his arms and began blessing them, laying his hands on them.
10-17|Mark|As he was going on his way, a man ran up and fell on his knees before him and put the question to him: “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit everlasting life?”
10-18|Mark|Jesus said to him: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except one, God.
10-19|Mark|You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and your mother.’”
10-20|Mark|The man said to him: “Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth on.”
10-21|Mark|Jesus looked at him and felt love for him and said, “One thing is missing about you: Go, sell what things you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come be my follower.”
10-22|Mark|But he grew sad at the answer and went away grieved, for he had many possessions.
10-23|Mark|After looking around, Jesus said to his disciples: “How difficult it will be for those with money to enter into the Kingdom of God!”
10-24|Mark|But the disciples were surprised at his words. Jesus then responded: “Children, how difficult it is to enter into the Kingdom of God!
10-25|Mark|It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.”
10-26|Mark|They became still more astounded and said to him: “Who possibly can be saved?”
10-27|Mark|Looking straight at them, Jesus said: “With men it is impossible but not so with God, for all things are possible with God.”
10-28|Mark|Peter began to say to him: “Look! We have left all things and followed you.”
10-29|Mark|Jesus said: “Truly I say to you, no one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news
10-30|Mark|who will not get 100 times more now in this period of time—houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, with persecutions—and in the coming system of things, everlasting life.
10-31|Mark|But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
10-32|Mark|Now they were going on the road up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them, and they were astonished, but those who followed began to fear. Once again he took the Twelve aside and started to tell them these things that were about to happen to him:
10-33|Mark|“Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to men of the nations,
10-34|Mark|and these will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him, but three days later he will rise.”
10-35|Mark|James and John, the sons of Zebʹe·dee, approached him and said to him: “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”
10-36|Mark|He said to them: “What do you want me to do for you?”
10-37|Mark|They replied: “Grant us to sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”
10-38|Mark|But Jesus said to them: “You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink the cup that I am drinking or be baptized with the baptism with which I am being baptized?”
10-39|Mark|They said to him: “We can.” At that Jesus said to them: “The cup I am drinking, you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am being baptized, you will be baptized.
10-40|Mark|However, to sit down at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared.”
10-41|Mark|When the ten others heard about it, they became indignant at James and John.
10-42|Mark|But Jesus called them to him and said to them: “You know that those who appear to be ruling the nations lord it over them and their great ones wield authority over them.
10-43|Mark|This must not be the way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister,
10-44|Mark|and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all.
10-45|Mark|For even the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.”
10-46|Mark|They then came into Jerʹi·cho. But as he and his disciples and a considerable crowd were going out of Jerʹi·cho, Bar·ti·maeʹus (the son of Ti·maeʹus), a blind beggar, was sitting beside the road.
10-47|Mark|When he heard that it was Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ, he started shouting and saying: “Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!”
10-48|Mark|At this many began rebuking him, telling him to be silent, but all the more he kept shouting: “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
10-49|Mark|So Jesus stopped and said: “Call him to me.” So they called the blind man, saying to him: “Take courage! Get up; he is calling you.”
10-50|Mark|Throwing off his outer garment, he leaped to his feet and went to Jesus.
10-51|Mark|Then Jesus said to him: “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him: “Rab·boʹni, let me recover my sight.”
10-52|Mark|And Jesus said to him: “Go. Your faith has made you well.” And immediately he recovered his sight, and he began to follow him on the road.
01-01|Luke|Seeing that many have undertaken to compile an account of the facts that are given full credence among us,
01-02|Luke|just as these were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and attendants of the message,
01-03|Luke|I resolved also, because I have traced all things from the start with accuracy, to write them to you in logical order, most excellent The·ophʹi·lus,
01-04|Luke|so that you may know fully the certainty of the things that you have been taught orally.
01-05|Luke|In the days of Herod, king of Ju·deʹa, there was a priest named Zech·a·riʹah of the division of A·biʹjah. His wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
01-06|Luke|They both were righteous before God, walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of Jehovah.
01-07|Luke|But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well along in years.
01-08|Luke|Now as he was serving as priest in the assignment of his division before God,
01-09|Luke|according to the established practice of the priesthood it became his turn to offer incense when he entered into the sanctuary of Jehovah.
01-10|Luke|And the entire multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of offering incense.
01-11|Luke|Jehovah’s angel appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar.
01-12|Luke|But Zech·a·riʹah became troubled at the sight, and he was overcome with fear.
01-13|Luke|However, the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zech·a·riʹah, because your supplication has been favorably heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John.
01-14|Luke|You will have joy and great gladness, and many will rejoice over his birth,
01-15|Luke|for he will be great in the sight of Jehovah. But he must drink no wine or any alcoholic drink at all, and he will be filled with holy spirit even from before birth,
01-16|Luke|and he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to Jehovah their God.
01-17|Luke|Also, he will go ahead of him with E·liʹjah’s spirit and power, to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones, in order to get ready for Jehovah a prepared people.”
01-18|Luke|Zech·a·riʹah said to the angel: “How can I be sure of this? For I am old, and my wife is well along in years.”
01-19|Luke|In reply the angel said to him: “I am Gaʹbri·el, who stands near before God, and I was sent to speak with you and to declare this good news to you.
01-20|Luke|But look! you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their appointed time.”
01-21|Luke|Meanwhile, the people continued waiting for Zech·a·riʹah, and they were surprised that he delayed so long in the sanctuary.
01-22|Luke|When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had just seen a supernatural sight in the sanctuary. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless.
01-23|Luke|When the days of his holy service were completed, he went off to his home.
01-24|Luke|Some days later Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself secluded for five months, saying:
01-25|Luke|“This is how Jehovah has dealt with me in these days. He has turned his attention to me to take away my reproach among men.”
01-26|Luke|In her sixth month, the angel Gaʹbri·el was sent from God to a city of Galʹi·lee named Nazʹa·reth,
01-27|Luke|to a virgin promised in marriage to a man named Joseph of David’s house, and the name of the virgin was Mary.
01-28|Luke|And coming in, the angel said to her: “Greetings, you highly favored one, Jehovah is with you.”
01-29|Luke|But she was deeply disturbed at his words and tried to understand what kind of greeting this might be.
01-30|Luke|So the angel said to her: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
01-31|Luke|And look! you will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus.
01-32|Luke|This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father,
01-33|Luke|and he will rule as King over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end to his Kingdom.”
01-34|Luke|But Mary said to the angel: “How is this to be, since I am not having sexual relations with a man?”
01-35|Luke|In answer the angel said to her: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy, God’s Son.
01-36|Luke|And look! Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son, in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her, the so-called barren woman;
01-37|Luke|for no declaration will be impossible for God.”
01-38|Luke|Then Mary said: “Look! Jehovah’s slave girl! May it happen to me according to your declaration.” At that the angel departed from her.
01-39|Luke|So Mary set out in those days and traveled with haste into the mountainous country, to a city of Judah,
01-40|Luke|and she entered the home of Zech·a·riʹah and greeted Elizabeth.
01-41|Luke|Well, as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant in her womb leaped, and Elizabeth was filled with holy spirit
01-42|Luke|and loudly cried out: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruitage of your womb!
01-43|Luke|So how is it that this privilege is mine, to have the mother of my Lord come to me?
01-44|Luke|For look! as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.
01-45|Luke|Happy too is she who believed, for there will be a complete fulfillment of those things spoken to her from Jehovah.”
01-46|Luke|And Mary said: “My soul magnifies Jehovah,
01-47|Luke|and my spirit cannot keep from being overjoyed at God my Savior,
01-48|Luke|because he has looked upon the low position of his slave girl. For look! from now on all generations will declare me happy,
01-49|Luke|because the powerful One has done great deeds for me, and holy is his name,
01-50|Luke|and for generation after generation his mercy is upon those who fear him.
01-51|Luke|He has acted mightily with his arm; he has scattered those who are haughty in the intention of their hearts.
01-52|Luke|He has brought down powerful men from thrones and has exalted lowly ones;
01-53|Luke|he has fully satisfied hungry ones with good things and has sent away empty-handed those who had wealth.
01-54|Luke|He has come to the aid of Israel his servant, remembering his mercy,
01-55|Luke|just as he spoke to our forefathers, to Abraham and to his offspring, forever.”
01-56|Luke|Mary stayed with her about three months and then returned to her own home.
01-57|Luke|The time now came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son.
01-58|Luke|And the neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah had magnified his mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
01-59|Luke|On the eighth day they came to circumcise the young child, and they were going to name him after his father, Zech·a·riʹah.
02-01|Luke|Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Au·gusʹtus for all the inhabited earth to be registered.
02-02|Luke|(This first registration took place when Qui·rinʹi·us was governor of Syria.)
02-03|Luke|And all the people went to be registered, each one to his own city.
02-04|Luke|Of course, Joseph also went up from Galʹi·lee, from the city of Nazʹa·reth, into Ju·deʹa, to David’s city, which is called Bethʹle·hem, because of his being a member of the house and family of David.
02-05|Luke|He went to get registered with Mary, who had been given him in marriage as promised and who was soon to give birth.
02-06|Luke|While they were there, the time came for her to give birth.
02-07|Luke|And she gave birth to her son, the firstborn, and she wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the lodging place.
02-08|Luke|There were also in the same region shepherds living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks.
02-09|Luke|Suddenly Jehovah’s angel stood before them, and Jehovah’s glory gleamed around them, and they became very fearful.
02-10|Luke|But the angel said to them: “Do not be afraid, for look! I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have.
02-11|Luke|For today there was born to you in David’s city a savior, who is Christ the Lord.
02-12|Luke|And this is a sign for you: You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”
02-13|Luke|Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying:
02-14|Luke|“Glory in the heights above to God, and on earth peace among men of goodwill.”
02-15|Luke|So when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another: “Let us by all means go over to Bethʹle·hem and see what has taken place, which Jehovah has made known to us.”
02-16|Luke|And they went quickly and found Mary as well as Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.
02-17|Luke|When they saw this, they made known the message that they had been told concerning this young child.
02-18|Luke|And all who heard were astonished at what the shepherds told them,
02-19|Luke|but Mary began to preserve all these sayings, drawing conclusions in her heart.
02-20|Luke|Then the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.
02-21|Luke|After eight days, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived.
02-22|Luke|Also, when the time came for purifying them according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to Jehovah,
02-23|Luke|just as it is written in Jehovah’s Law: “Every firstborn male must be called holy to Jehovah.”
02-24|Luke|And they offered a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of Jehovah: “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”
02-25|Luke|And look! there was a man in Jerusalem named Simʹe·on, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for Israel’s consolation, and holy spirit was upon him.
02-26|Luke|Furthermore, it had been divinely revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Christ of Jehovah.
02-27|Luke|Under the power of the spirit, he now came into the temple, and as the parents brought the young child Jesus in to do for him according to the customary practice of the Law,
02-28|Luke|he took the child into his arms and praised God and said:
02-29|Luke|“Now, Sovereign Lord, you are letting your slave go in peace according to your declaration,
02-30|Luke|because my eyes have seen your means of salvation
02-31|Luke|that you have prepared in the sight of all the peoples,
02-32|Luke|a light for removing the veil from the nations and a glory of your people Israel.”
02-33|Luke|And the child’s father and mother continued wondering at the things being spoken about him.
02-34|Luke|Also, Simʹe·on blessed them and said to Mary, the child’s mother: “Look! This child is appointed for the falling and the rising again of many in Israel and for a sign to be spoken against
02-35|Luke|(yes, a long sword will be run through you), in order that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.”
02-36|Luke|Now there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanʹu·el, of Ashʹer’s tribe. This woman was well along in years and had lived with her husband for seven years after they were married,
02-37|Luke|and she was a widow now 84 years old. She was never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service night and day with fasting and supplications.
02-38|Luke|In that very hour she came near and began giving thanks to God and speaking about the child to all who were waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance.
02-39|Luke|So when they had carried out all the things according to the Law of Jehovah, they went back into Galʹi·lee to their own city, Nazʹa·reth.
02-40|Luke|And the young child continued growing and getting strong, being filled with wisdom, and God’s favor continued upon him.
02-41|Luke|Now his parents were accustomed to go from year to year to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover.
02-42|Luke|And when he was 12 years old, they went up according to the custom of the festival.
02-43|Luke|When the days of the festival were over and they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents did not notice it.
02-44|Luke|Assuming that he was in the group traveling together, they went a day’s journey and then began to search for him among the relatives and acquaintances.
02-45|Luke|But not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem and made a diligent search for him.
02-46|Luke|Well, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions.
02-47|Luke|But all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers.
02-48|Luke|Now when his parents saw him, they were astounded, and his mother said to him: “Child, why did you treat us this way? Here your father and I have been frantically looking for you.”
02-49|Luke|But he said to them: “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in the house of my Father?”
02-50|Luke|However, they did not understand what he was saying to them.
02-51|Luke|Then he went down with them and returned to Nazʹa·reth, and he continued subject to them. Also, his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart.
02-52|Luke|And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men.
08-01|Luke|Shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with him,
08-02|Luke|as were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magʹda·lene, from whom seven demons had come out;
08-03|Luke|Jo·anʹna the wife of Chuʹza, Herod’s man in charge; Su·sanʹna; and many other women, who were ministering to them from their belongings.
08-04|Luke|Now when a large crowd had gathered together with those who went to him from city to city, he spoke by means of an illustration:
08-05|Luke|“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some of them fell alongside the road and were trampled on, and the birds of heaven ate them up.
08-06|Luke|Some landed on the rock, and after sprouting, they dried up because they had no moisture.
08-07|Luke|Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with them choked them.
08-08|Luke|But others fell on the good soil, and after sprouting, they produced 100 times more fruit.” As he said these things, he called out: “Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.”
08-09|Luke|But his disciples asked him what this illustration meant.
08-10|Luke|He said: “To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of God, but for the rest it is in illustrations so that, though looking, they may look in vain, and though hearing, they may not get the sense.
08-11|Luke|Now the illustration means this: The seed is the word of God.
08-12|Luke|Those alongside the road are the ones who have heard, and then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved.
08-13|Luke|Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy, but these have no root. They believe for a while, but in a season of testing, they fall away.
08-14|Luke|As for that which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, but by being carried away by anxieties, riches, and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to maturity.
08-15|Luke|As for that on the fine soil, these are the ones who, after hearing the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.
08-16|Luke|“No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light.
08-17|Luke|For there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest, nor anything carefully concealed that will never become known and not come out in the open.
08-18|Luke|Therefore, pay attention to how you listen, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.”
08-19|Luke|Now his mother and brothers came to him, but they were unable to get near him because of the crowd.
08-20|Luke|So it was reported to him: “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
08-21|Luke|In reply he said to them: “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”
08-22|Luke|One day he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them: “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So they set sail.
08-23|Luke|But as they were sailing along, he fell asleep. And a violent windstorm descended on the lake, and their boat began to fill up with water and to be in danger.
08-24|Luke|So they went and woke him up, saying: “Instructor, Instructor, we are about to perish!” With that he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they subsided, and a calm set in.
08-25|Luke|Then he said to them: “Where is your faith?” But they were filled with fear and were astounded, saying to one another: “Who really is this? For he orders even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”
08-26|Luke|And they put in to shore in the region of the Gerʹa·senes, which is on the side opposite Galʹi·lee.
08-27|Luke|As Jesus got out onto land, a demon-possessed man from the city met him. For a considerable time he had not worn clothing, and he was staying, not in a house, but among the tombs.
08-28|Luke|At the sight of Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice, he said: “What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”
08-29|Luke|(For Jesus had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. It had seized him on many occasions, and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the isolated places.)
08-30|Luke|Jesus asked him: “What is your name?” He said: “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.
08-31|Luke|And they kept pleading with him not to order them to go away into the abyss.
08-32|Luke|Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain, so they pleaded with him to permit them to enter into the swine, and he gave them permission.
08-33|Luke|With that the demons came out of the man and went into the swine, and the herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and drowned.
08-34|Luke|But when the herders saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.
08-35|Luke|Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, and they grew fearful.
08-36|Luke|Those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been made well.
08-37|Luke|Then a great number from the surrounding region of the Gerʹa·senes asked Jesus to go away from them, because they were gripped by great fear. Then he went aboard the boat to depart.
08-38|Luke|However, the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging to continue with him, but he sent the man away, saying:
08-39|Luke|“Go back home, and keep on relating what God did for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.
08-40|Luke|When Jesus returned, the crowd received him kindly, for they were all expecting him.
08-41|Luke|But look! a man named Jaʹi·rus came; this man was a presiding officer of the synagogue. And he fell at the feet of Jesus and began to plead with him to come to his house,
08-42|Luke|because his only daughter, who was about 12 years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the crowds pressed in on him.
08-43|Luke|Now there was a woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years, and she had not been able to get a cure from anyone.
08-44|Luke|She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment, and immediately her flow of blood stopped.
08-45|Luke|So Jesus said: “Who touched me?” When they were all denying it, Peter said: “Instructor, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing against you.”
08-46|Luke|But Jesus said: “Someone touched me, for I know that power went out of me.”
08-47|Luke|Seeing that she had not escaped notice, the woman came trembling and fell down before him and declared before all the people why she touched him and how she was healed immediately.
08-48|Luke|But he said to her: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
08-49|Luke|While he was yet speaking, a representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came, saying: “Your daughter has died; do not bother the Teacher any longer.” 50 On hearing this, Jesus answered him: “Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be saved.”
08-51|Luke|When he reached the house, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the girl’s father and mother.
08-52|Luke|But people were all weeping and beating themselves in grief for her. So he said: “Stop weeping, for she did not die but is sleeping.”
08-53|Luke|At this they began to laugh at him scornfully, because they knew she had died.
08-54|Luke|But he took her by the hand and called to her: “Child, get up!”
08-55|Luke|And her spirit returned, and she rose immediately, and he ordered that something be given her to eat.
08-56|Luke|Well, her parents were beside themselves, but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
09-01|Luke|Then he called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.
09-02|Luke|And he sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal,
09-03|Luke|and he said to them: “Carry nothing for the trip, neither staff nor food pouch nor bread nor money; neither have two garments.
09-04|Luke|But wherever you enter into a home, stay there and leave from there.
09-05|Luke|And wherever people do not receive you, on going out of that city, shake the dust off your feet for a witness against them.”
09-06|Luke|Then starting out, they went through the territory from village to village, declaring the good news and performing cures everywhere.
09-07|Luke|Now Herod the district ruler heard about everything that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised up from the dead,
09-08|Luke|but others were saying that E·liʹjah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.
09-09|Luke|Herod said: “John I beheaded. Who, then, is this about whom I am hearing such things?” So he was trying to see him.
09-10|Luke|When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus all they had done. With that he took them along and withdrew privately into a city called Beth·saʹi·da.
09-11|Luke|But the crowds, getting to know it, followed him. And he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the Kingdom of God, and he healed those needing a cure.
09-12|Luke|Then the day was coming to a close. The Twelve now came up and said to him: “Send the crowd away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and provisions, because out here we are in an isolated place.”
09-13|Luke|But he said to them: “You give them something to eat.” They said: “We have nothing more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy food for all these people.”
09-14|Luke|There were, in fact, about 5,000 men. But he said to his disciples: “Have them sit down in groups of about 50 each.”
09-15|Luke|And they did so and had them all sit down.
09-16|Luke|Taking now the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke them up and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
09-17|Luke|So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftovers, 12 baskets of fragments.
09-18|Luke|Later, while he was praying alone, the disciples came to him, and he questioned them, saying: “Who are the crowds saying that I am?”
09-19|Luke|In reply they said: “John the Baptist, but others say E·liʹjah, and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”
09-20|Luke|Then he said to them: “You, though, who do you say I am?” Peter answered: “The Christ of God.”
09-21|Luke|Then in a stern talk to them, he instructed them not to tell this to anybody,
09-22|Luke|but he said: “The Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.”
09-23|Luke|Then he went on to say to all: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and keep following me.
09-24|Luke|For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake is the one who will save it.
09-25|Luke|Really, what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers ruin?
09-26|Luke|For whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels.
09-27|Luke|But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God.”
09-28|Luke|In fact, about eight days after saying these words, he took Peter, John, and James along and climbed up the mountain to pray.
09-29|Luke|And as he was praying, the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became glitteringly white.
09-30|Luke|And look! two men were conversing with him; they were Moses and E·liʹjah.
09-31|Luke|These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure, which he was about to fulfill at Jerusalem.
09-32|Luke|Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
09-33|Luke|And as these were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus: “Instructor, it is fine for us to be here. So let us erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for E·liʹjah.” He did not realize what he was saying.
09-34|Luke|But as he was saying these things, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them. As they entered into the cloud, they became afraid.
09-35|Luke|Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying: “This is my Son, the one who has been chosen. Listen to him.”
09-36|Luke|As the voice spoke, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet and did not report to anyone in those days any of the things they saw.
09-37|Luke|The following day when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
09-38|Luke|And look! a man called out from the crowd, saying: “Teacher, I beg you to take a look at my son, because he is my only one.
09-39|Luke|And look! a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth, and only with difficulty does it leave him after bruising him.
09-40|Luke|I begged your disciples to expel it, but they could not.”
09-41|Luke|In response Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with you and put up with you? Bring your son over here.”
09-42|Luke|But even as he was approaching, the demon hurled him to the ground and violently threw him into a convulsion. However, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
09-43|Luke|And they were all astounded at the majestic power of God. While they were all astonished at all the things he was doing, he said to his disciples:
09-44|Luke|“Listen carefully and remember these words, for the Son of man is going to be betrayed into men’s hands.”
09-45|Luke|But they did not understand what he was saying. In fact, it was concealed from them so that they might not grasp it, and they were afraid to question him about this saying.
09-46|Luke|Then a dispute arose among them about which one of them was the greatest.
09-47|Luke|Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a young child, stood him beside him,
09-48|Luke|and said to them: “Whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me also; and whoever receives me also receives the One who sent me. For the one who conducts himself as a lesser one among all of you is the one who is great.”
09-49|Luke|In response John said: “Instructor, we saw someone expelling demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he is not following with us.”
09-50|Luke|But Jesus said to him: “Do not try to prevent him, for whoever is not against you is for you.”
09-51|Luke|As the days were drawing near for him to be taken up, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.
09-52|Luke|So he sent messengers ahead of him. And they went and entered a village of Sa·marʹi·tans to make preparations for him.
09-53|Luke|But they did not receive him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem.
09-54|Luke|When the disciples James and John saw this, they said: “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them?”
09-55|Luke|But he turned and rebuked them.
09-56|Luke|So they went to a different village.
09-57|Luke|Now as they were going along the road, someone said to him: “I will follow you wherever you go.”
09-58|Luke|But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”
09-59|Luke|Then he said to another: “Be my follower.” The man said: “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”
10-01|Luke|After these things the Lord designated 70 others and sent them out by twos ahead of him into every city and place where he himself was to go.
10-02|Luke|Then he said to them: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.
10-03|Luke|Go! Look! I am sending you out as lambs in among wolves.
10-04|Luke|Do not carry a money bag or a food pouch or sandals, and do not greet anyone along the road.
10-05|Luke|Wherever you enter into a house, say first: ‘May this house have peace.’
10-06|Luke|And if a friend of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if there is not, it will return to you.
10-07|Luke|So stay in that house, eating and drinking the things they provide, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not keep transferring from house to house.
10-08|Luke|“Also, wherever you enter into a city and they receive you, eat what is set before you
10-09|Luke|and cure the sick ones in it and tell them: ‘The Kingdom of God has come near to you.’
10-10|Luke|But wherever you enter into a city and they do not receive you, go out into its main streets and say:
10-11|Luke|‘We wipe off against you even the dust that sticks to our feet from your city. Nevertheless, know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near.’
10-12|Luke|I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodʹom in that day than for that city.
10-13|Luke|“Woe to you, Cho·raʹzin! Woe to you, Beth·saʹi·da! because if the powerful works that have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Siʹdon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
10-14|Luke|Consequently, it will be more endurable for Tyre and Siʹdon in the judgment than for you.
10-15|Luke|And you, Ca·perʹna·um, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to the Grave you will come!
10-16|Luke|“Whoever listens to you listens to me. And whoever disregards you disregards me also. Moreover, whoever disregards me disregards also Him who sent me.”
10-17|Luke|Then the 70 returned with joy, saying: “Lord, even the demons are made subject to us by the use of your name.”
10-18|Luke|At that he said to them: “I see Satan already fallen like lightning from heaven.
10-19|Luke|Look! I have given you the authority to trample underfoot serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing at all will harm you.
10-20|Luke|Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens.”
10-21|Luke|In that very hour he became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children. Yes, O Father, because this is the way you approved.
10-22|Luke|All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”
10-23|Luke|With that he turned to the disciples and told them privately: “Happy are the eyes that see the things you are seeing.
10-24|Luke|For I say to you, many prophets and kings desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them, and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them.”
10-25|Luke|Now look! a man versed in the Law stood up to test him and said: “Teacher, what do I need to do to inherit everlasting life?”
10-26|Luke|He said to him: “What is written in the Law? How do you read?”
10-27|Luke|In answer he said: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself.’”
10-28|Luke|He said to him: “You answered correctly; keep doing this and you will get life.”
10-29|Luke|But wanting to prove himself righteous, the man said to Jesus: “Who really is my neighbor?”
10-30|Luke|In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jerʹi·cho and fell victim to robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went off, leaving him half-dead.
10-31|Luke|Now by coincidence a priest was going down on that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.
10-32|Luke|Likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side.
10-33|Luke|But a certain Sa·marʹi·tan traveling the road came upon him, and at seeing him, he was moved with pity.
10-34|Luke|So he approached him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
10-35|Luke|The next day he took out two de·narʹi·i, gave them to the innkeeper, and said: ‘Take care of him, and whatever you spend besides this, I will repay you when I return.’
10-36|Luke|Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man who fell victim to the robbers?”
10-37|Luke|He said: “The one who acted mercifully toward him.” Jesus then said to him: “Go and do the same yourself.”
10-38|Luke|Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village. Here a woman named Martha received him as a guest in her house.
10-39|Luke|She also had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what he was saying.
10-40|Luke|Martha, on the other hand, was distracted with attending to many duties. So she came to him and said: “Lord, does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things? Tell her to come and help me.”
10-41|Luke|In answer the Lord said to her: “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disturbed about many things.
10-42|Luke|A few things, though, are needed, or just one. For her part, Mary chose the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.”
11-01|Luke|Now he was in a certain place praying, and when he stopped, one of his disciples said to him: “Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”
11-02|Luke|So he said to them: “Whenever you pray, say: ‘Father, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come.
11-03|Luke|Give us each day our bread according to our daily needs.
11-04|Luke|And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is in debt to us; and do not bring us into temptation.’”
11-05|Luke|Then he said to them: “Suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves,
11-06|Luke|because one of my friends has just come to me on a journey and I have nothing to offer him.’
11-07|Luke|But that one replies from inside: ‘Stop bothering me. The door is already locked, and my young children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything.’
11-08|Luke|I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because of being his friend, certainly because of his bold persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.
11-09|Luke|So I say to you, keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you.
11-10|Luke|For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened.
11-11|Luke|Indeed, which father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent instead of a fish?
11-12|Luke|Or if he also asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion?
11-13|Luke|Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!”
11-14|Luke|Later he expelled a speechless demon. After the demon came out, the speechless man spoke, and the crowds were amazed.
11-15|Luke|But some of them said: “He expels the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub, the ruler of the demons.”
11-16|Luke|And others, to test him, began demanding a sign out of heaven from him.
11-17|Luke|Knowing their thinking, he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin, and a house divided against itself falls.
11-18|Luke|In the same way, if Satan is also divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I expel the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub.
11-19|Luke|If I expel the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub, by whom do your sons expel them? This is why they will be your judges.
11-20|Luke|But if it is by means of God’s finger that I expel the demons, the Kingdom of God has really overtaken you.
11-21|Luke|When a strong, well-armed man guards his palace, his belongings remain secure.
11-22|Luke|But when someone stronger than he is comes against him and conquers him, that man takes away all his weapons in which he was trusting, and he divides up the things he took from him.
11-23|Luke|Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
11-24|Luke|“When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through waterless places in search of a resting-place, and after finding none, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I moved.’
11-25|Luke|And on arriving, it finds the house swept clean and adorned.
11-26|Luke|Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and after getting inside, they dwell there. So the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first.”
11-27|Luke|Now as he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd called out to him: “Happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that nursed you!”
11-28|Luke|But he said: “No, rather, happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”
11-29|Luke|When the crowds were massing together, he began to say: “This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Joʹnah.
11-30|Luke|For just as Joʹnah became a sign to the Ninʹe·vites, so will the Son of man be to this generation.
11-31|Luke|The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solʹo·mon. But look! something more than Solʹo·mon is here.
11-32|Luke|The men of Ninʹe·veh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at what Joʹnah preached. But look! something more than Joʹnah is here.
11-33|Luke|After lighting a lamp, a person puts it, not in a hidden place nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.
11-34|Luke|The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is focused, your whole body is also bright; but when it is envious, your body is also dark.
11-35|Luke|Be alert, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness.
11-36|Luke|Therefore, if your whole body is bright with no part of it dark, it will all be as bright as when a lamp gives you light by its rays.”
11-37|Luke|When he had said this, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at the table.
11-38|Luke|However, the Pharisee was surprised at seeing that he did not first wash before the dinner.
11-39|Luke|But the Lord said to him: “Now you Pharisees, you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greediness and wickedness.
11-40|Luke|Unreasonable ones! The one who made the outside made also the inside, did he not?
11-41|Luke|But give as gifts of mercy the things that are from within, and look! everything about you will be clean.
11-42|Luke|But woe to you Pharisees, because you give the tenth of the mint and of the rue and of every other garden herb, but you disregard the justice and the love of God! These things you were under obligation to do, but not to disregard those other things.
11-43|Luke|Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces!
11-44|Luke|Woe to you, because you are as those graves that are not clearly visible, that men walk on and do not know it!”
11-45|Luke|In reply one of those versed in the Law said to him: “Teacher, in saying these things, you insult us also.”
11-46|Luke|Then he said: “Woe also to you who are versed in the Law, because you load men down with loads hard to carry, but you yourselves do not touch the loads with one of your fingers!
11-47|Luke|“Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, but your forefathers killed them!
11-48|Luke|Certainly you are witnesses of the deeds of your forefathers, and yet you approve of them, for they killed the prophets but you are building their tombs.
11-49|Luke|That is why the wisdom of God also said: ‘I will send prophets and apostles to them, and they will kill and persecute some of them,
11-50|Luke|so that the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world may be charged against this generation,
11-51|Luke|from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zech·a·riʹah, who was killed between the altar and the house.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.
11-52|Luke|“Woe to you who are versed in the Law, because you took away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not go in, and you hinder those going in!”
11-53|Luke|So when he went out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to put extreme pressure on him and to ply him with many more questions,
11-54|Luke|lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say.
12-01|Luke|In the meantime, when a crowd of so many thousands had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, he started by saying first to his disciples: “Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
12-02|Luke|But there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not become known.
12-03|Luke|Therefore, whatever you say in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you whisper in private rooms will be preached from the housetops.
12-04|Luke|Moreover, I say to you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more.
12-05|Luke|But I will show you whom to fear: Fear the One who after killing has authority to throw into Ge·henʹna. Yes, I tell you, fear this One.
12-06|Luke|Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value, do they not? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
12-07|Luke|But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.
12-08|Luke|“I say to you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.
12-09|Luke|But whoever disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.
12-10|Luke|And everyone who says a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven.
12-11|Luke|When they bring you in before public assemblies, government officials, and authorities, do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in defense or what you will say,
12-12|Luke|for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you should say.”
12-13|Luke|Then someone in the crowd said to him: “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
12-14|Luke|He said to him: “Man, who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two?”
12-15|Luke|Then he said to them: “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.”
12-16|Luke|With that he told them an illustration, saying: “The land of a rich man produced well.
12-17|Luke|So he began reasoning within himself, ‘What should I do now that I have nowhere to gather my crops?’
12-18|Luke|Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones, and there I will gather all my grain and all my goods,
12-19|Luke|and I will say to myself: “You have many good things stored up for many years; take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.”’
12-20|Luke|But God said to him, ‘Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your life from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?’
12-21|Luke|So it goes with the man who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”
12-22|Luke|Then he said to his disciples: “That is why I say to you, stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or about your bodies as to what you will wear.
12-23|Luke|For the life is worth more than food and the body more than clothing.
12-24|Luke|Consider the ravens: They neither sow seed nor reap; they have neither barn nor storehouse; yet God feeds them. Are you not worth much more than birds?
12-25|Luke|Who of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his life span?
12-26|Luke|If, therefore, you cannot do such a small thing, why be anxious about the remaining things?
12-27|Luke|Consider how the lilies grow: They neither toil nor spin; but I tell you that not even Solʹo·mon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
12-28|Luke|Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation in the field that today exists and tomorrow is cast into an oven, how much more will he clothe you, you with little faith!
12-29|Luke|So stop seeking what you will eat and what you will drink, and stop being in anxious suspense;
12-30|Luke|for all these are the things the nations of the world are eagerly pursuing, but your Father knows you need these things.
12-31|Luke|Instead, keep seeking his Kingdom, and these things will be added to you.
12-32|Luke|“Have no fear, little flock, for your Father has approved of giving you the Kingdom.
12-33|Luke|Sell your belongings and give gifts of mercy. Make money pouches that do not wear out, a never-failing treasure in the heavens, where no thief gets near and no moth consumes.
12-34|Luke|For where your treasure is, there your hearts will be also.
12-35|Luke|“Be dressed and ready and have your lamps burning,
12-36|Luke|and you should be like men waiting for their master to return from the marriage, so when he comes and knocks, they may at once open to him.
12-37|Luke|Happy are those slaves whom the master on coming finds watching! Truly I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come alongside and minister to them.
12-38|Luke|And if he comes in the second watch, even if in the third, and finds them ready, happy are they!
12-39|Luke|But know this, if the householder had known at what hour the thief would come, he would not have let his house be broken into.
12-40|Luke|You also, keep ready, because at an hour that you do not think likely, the Son of man is coming.”
12-41|Luke|Then Peter said: “Lord, are you telling this illustration just to us or also to everyone?”
12-42|Luke|And the Lord said: “Who really is the faithful steward, the discreet one, whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time?
12-43|Luke|Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so!
12-44|Luke|I tell you truthfully, he will appoint him over all his belongings.
12-45|Luke|But if ever that slave should say in his heart, ‘My master delays coming,’ and starts to beat the male and female servants and to eat and drink and get drunk,
12-46|Luke|the master of that slave will come on a day that he is not expecting him and at an hour that he does not know, and he will punish him with the greatest severity and assign him a part with the unfaithful ones.
12-47|Luke|Then that slave who understood the will of his master but did not get ready or do what he asked will be beaten with many strokes.
12-48|Luke|But the one who did not understand and yet did things deserving of strokes will be beaten with few. Indeed, everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded of him, and the one who was put in charge of much will have more than usual demanded of him.
12-49|Luke|“I came to start a fire on the earth, and what more is there for me to wish if it has already been lit?
12-50|Luke|Indeed, I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and how I am distressed until it is finished!
12-51|Luke|Do you think I came to give peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
12-52|Luke|For from now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two and two against three.
12-53|Luke|They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”
12-54|Luke|Then he also said to the crowds: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, at once you say, ‘A storm is coming,’ and it happens.
12-55|Luke|And when you see that a south wind is blowing, you say, ‘There will be a heat wave,’ and it occurs.
12-56|Luke|Hypocrites, you know how to examine the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to examine this particular time?
12-57|Luke|Why do you not judge also for yourselves what is righteous?
12-58|Luke|For example, when you are going with your legal opponent to a ruler, while on the way, get to work to settle the dispute with him so that he may not summon you before the judge, and the judge deliver you to the court officer, and the court officer throw you into prison.
12-59|Luke|I tell you, you will certainly not get out of there until you pay over your last small coin.”
22-01|Luke|Now the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, which is called Passover, was getting near.
22-02|Luke|And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for an effective way to get rid of him, because they were afraid of the people.
22-03|Luke|Then Satan entered into Judas, the one called Is·carʹi·ot, who was numbered among the Twelve,
22-04|Luke|and he went off and talked with the chief priests and temple captains about how to betray him to them.
22-05|Luke|They were delighted at this and agreed to give him silver money.
22-06|Luke|So he consented and began looking for a good opportunity to betray him to them without a crowd around.
22-07|Luke|The day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived, on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered;
22-08|Luke|so Jesus sent Peter and John, saying: “Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.”
22-09|Luke|They said to him: “Where do you want us to get it ready?”
22-10|Luke|He said to them: “Look! When you enter into the city, a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters.
22-11|Luke|And say to the landlord of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you: “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’
22-12|Luke|And that man will show you a large, furnished upper room. Get it ready there.”
22-13|Luke|So they left and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared for the Passover.
22-14|Luke|So when the hour came, he reclined at the table along with the apostles.
22-15|Luke|And he said to them: “I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
22-16|Luke|for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.”
22-17|Luke|And accepting a cup, he gave thanks and said: “Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves,
22-18|Luke|for I tell you, from now on, I will not drink again from the product of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes.”
22-19|Luke|Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: “This means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”
22-20|Luke|Also, he did the same with the cup after they had the evening meal, saying: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.
22-21|Luke|“But look! the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table.
22-22|Luke|For, indeed, the Son of man is going his way according to what has been determined; all the same, woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”
22-23|Luke|So they began to discuss among themselves which one of them could really be about to do this.
22-24|Luke|However, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered to be the greatest.
22-25|Luke|But he said to them: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those having authority over them are called Benefactors.
22-26|Luke|You, though, are not to be that way. But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the one taking the lead as the one ministering.
22-27|Luke|For which one is greater, the one dining or the one serving? Is it not the one dining? But I am among you as the one serving.
22-28|Luke|“However, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials;
22-29|Luke|and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom,
22-30|Luke|so that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the 12 tribes of Israel.
22-31|Luke|“Simon, Simon, look! Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat.
22-32|Luke|But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.”
22-33|Luke|Then he said to him: “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.”
22-34|Luke|But he said: “I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times.”
22-35|Luke|He also said to them: “When I sent you out without a money bag and a food pouch and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” They said: “No!”
22-36|Luke|Then he said to them: “But now let the one who has a money bag take it, likewise a food pouch, and let the one who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one.
22-37|Luke|For I tell you that what is written must be accomplished in me, namely, ‘He was counted with lawless ones.’ For this is being fulfilled concerning me.”
22-38|Luke|Then they said: “Lord, look! here are two swords.” He said to them: “It is enough.”
22-39|Luke|On leaving, he went as was his custom to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.
22-40|Luke|On arriving at the place, he said to them: “Carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation.”
22-41|Luke|And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw away, and he bent his knees and began to pray,
22-42|Luke|saying: “Father, if you want to, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.”
22-43|Luke|Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.
22-44|Luke|But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly; and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground.
22-45|Luke|When he rose from prayer and went to the disciples, he found them slumbering, exhausted from grief.
22-46|Luke|He said to them: “Why are you sleeping? Get up and keep praying, so that you do not enter into temptation.”
22-47|Luke|While he was still speaking, look! a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them, and he approached Jesus to kiss him.
22-48|Luke|But Jesus said to him: “Judas, are you betraying the Son of man with a kiss?”
22-49|Luke|When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said: “Lord, should we strike with the sword?”
22-50|Luke|One of them even struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his right ear.
22-51|Luke|But in reply Jesus said: “That is enough.” And he touched the ear and healed him.
22-52|Luke|Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come there for him: “Did you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?
22-53|Luke|While I was with you in the temple day after day, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness.”
22-54|Luke|Then they arrested him and led him off, and they brought him into the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance.
22-55|Luke|When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting among them.
22-56|Luke|But a servant girl, seeing him sitting in the light of the fire, looked closely at him and said: “This man was also with him.”
22-57|Luke|But he denied it, saying: “I do not know him, woman.”
22-58|Luke|After a short time another person saw him and said: “You too are one of them.” But Peter said: “Man, I am not.”
22-59|Luke|And after about an hour had passed, another man began insisting strongly: “Certainly this man was also with him, for he is, in fact, a Gal·i·leʹan!”
23-01|Luke|So the multitude got up, one and all, and led him to Pilate.
23-02|Luke|Then they began to accuse him, saying: “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding the paying of taxes to Caesar, and saying he himself is Christ a king.”
23-03|Luke|Now Pilate asked him the question: “Are you the King of the Jews?” In answer he said: “You yourself are saying it.”
23-04|Luke|Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: “I find no crime in this man.”
23-05|Luke|But they insisted, saying: “He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Ju·deʹa, starting from Galʹi·lee even to here.”
23-06|Luke|On hearing that, Pilate asked whether the man was a Gal·i·leʹan.
23-07|Luke|After ascertaining that he was under the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him on to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.
23-08|Luke|When Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly. For a considerable time he had been wanting to see Jesus because he had heard much about him, and he was hoping to see some sign performed by him.
23-09|Luke|So he began to question him at length, but he gave him no answer.
23-10|Luke|However, the chief priests and the scribes kept standing up and vehemently accusing him.
23-11|Luke|Then Herod together with his soldiers treated him with contempt, and he mocked him by clothing him with a splendid garment and then sent him back to Pilate.
23-12|Luke|Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that very day, for before that they had been at enmity with each other.13 Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people
23-14|Luke|and said to them: “You brought this man to me as one inciting the people to revolt. Now look! I examined him in front of you but found in this man no grounds for the charges you are bringing against him.
23-15|Luke|In fact, neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us, and look! he has done nothing deserving of death.
23-16|Luke|I will therefore punish him and release him.”
23-17|Luke|——
23-18|Luke|But the whole crowd shouted out: “Do away with this man, and release Bar·abʹbas to us!”
23-19|Luke|(This man had been thrown into prison for sedition that had occurred in the city and for murder.)
23-20|Luke|Again Pilate called out to them, because he wanted to release Jesus.
23-21|Luke|Then they began to yell, saying: “To the stake with him! To the stake with him!”
23-22|Luke|The third time he said to them: “Why? What bad thing did this man do? I found in him nothing deserving of death; I will therefore punish him and release him.”
23-23|Luke|At this they became insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be executed, and their voices prevailed.
23-24|Luke|So Pilate made the decision that their demand be met.
23-25|Luke|He released the man whom they were demanding, who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder, but he surrendered Jesus to their will.26 Now as they led him away, they seized a certain Simon of Cy·reʹne, who was coming from the countryside, and they placed the torture stake on him to carry it behind Jesus.
23-27|Luke|A large number of people were following him, including women who kept beating themselves in grief and wailing for him.
23-28|Luke|Jesus turned to the women and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for me. Weep instead for yourselves and for your children;
23-29|Luke|for look! days are coming when people will say, ‘Happy are the barren women, the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse!’
23-30|Luke|Then they will start saying to the mountains, ‘Fall over us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us over!’
23-31|Luke|If they do these things when the tree is moist, what will occur when it is withered?”32 Two other men, criminals, were also being led off to be executed with him.
23-33|Luke|And when they got to the place called Skull, they nailed him to the stake there alongside the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
23-34|Luke|But Jesus was saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Furthermore, they cast lots to distribute his garments.
23-35|Luke|And the people stood looking on. But the rulers were sneering and saying: “Others he saved; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”
23-36|Luke|Even the soldiers mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine
23-37|Luke|and saying: “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.”
23-38|Luke|There was also an inscription over him: “This is the King of the Jews.”39 Then one of the criminals hanging there began to speak abusively to him, saying: “You are the Christ, are you not? Save yourself and us too!”
23-40|Luke|In response the other rebuked him, saying: “Do you not fear God at all, now that you have received the same judgment?
23-41|Luke|And we rightly so, for we are getting back what we deserve for the things we did; but this man did nothing wrong.”
23-42|Luke|Then he said: “Jesus, remember me when you get into your Kingdom.”
23-43|Luke|And he said to him: “Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in Paradise.”44 Well, by now it was about the sixth hour, and yet a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour,
23-45|Luke|because the sunlight failed; then the curtain of the sanctuary was torn down the middle.
23-46|Luke|And Jesus called out with a loud voice and said: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” After he said this, he expired.
23-47|Luke|Because of seeing what occurred, the army officer began to glorify God, saying: “Truly, this man was righteous.”
23-48|Luke|And when all the crowds that were gathered together there for this spectacle saw the things that occurred, they returned home, beating their chests.
23-49|Luke|And all those acquainted with him were standing at a distance. Also, women who had accompanied him from Galʹi·lee were there and saw these things.50 And look! there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, who was a good and righteous man.
23-51|Luke|(This man had not voted in support of their scheme and action.) He was from Ar·i·ma·theʹa, a city of the Ju·deʹans, and was waiting for the Kingdom of God.
23-52|Luke|This man went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
23-53|Luke|And he took it down and wrapped it up in fine linen, and he laid it in a tomb carved in the rock, where no man had yet lain.
23-54|Luke|Now it was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
23-55|Luke|But the women who had come with him from Galʹi·lee followed along and took a look at the tomb and saw how his body was laid,
23-56|Luke|and they went back to prepare spices and perfumed oils. But, of course, they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.
04-01|John|When the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John—
04-02|John|although Jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did—
04-03|John|he left Ju·deʹa and departed again for Galʹi·lee.
04-04|John|But it was necessary for him to go through Sa·marʹi·a.
04-05|John|So he came to a city of Sa·marʹi·a called Syʹchar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
04-06|John|In fact, Jacob’s well was there. Now Jesus, tired out as he was from the journey, was sitting at the well. It was about the sixth hour.
04-07|John|A woman of Sa·marʹi·a came to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.”
04-08|John|(For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy food.)
04-09|John|So the Sa·marʹi·tan woman said to him: “How is it that you, despite being a Jew, ask me for a drink even though I am a Sa·marʹi·tan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Sa·marʹi·tans.)
04-10|John|In answer Jesus said to her: “If you had known of the free gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
04-11|John|She said to him: “Sir, you do not even have a bucket for drawing water, and the well is deep. From what source, then, do you have this living water?
04-12|John|You are not greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well and who together with his sons and his cattle drank out of it, are you?”
04-13|John|In answer Jesus said to her: “Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again.
04-14|John|Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.”
04-15|John|The woman said to him: “Sir, give me this water, so that I may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water.”
04-16|John|He said to her: “Go, call your husband and come to this place.”
04-17|John|The woman replied: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You are right in saying, ‘I do not have a husband.’
04-18|John|For you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. This you have said truthfully.”
04-19|John|The woman said to him: “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.
04-20|John|Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.”
04-21|John|Jesus said to her: “Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.
04-22|John|You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation begins with the Jews.
04-23|John|Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him.
04-24|John|God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth.”
04-25|John|The woman said to him: “I know that Mes·siʹah is coming, who is called Christ. Whenever that one comes, he will declare all things to us openly.”
04-26|John|Jesus said to her: “I am he, the one speaking to you.”
04-27|John|Just then his disciples arrived, and they were surprised because he was speaking with a woman. Of course, no one said: “What are you looking for?” or “Why are you talking to her?”
04-28|John|So the woman left her water jar and went off into the city and told the people:
04-29|John|“Come and see a man who told me everything I did. Could this not perhaps be the Christ?”
04-30|John|They left the city and began coming to him.
04-31|John|Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him: “Rabbi, eat.”
04-32|John|But he said to them: “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”
04-33|John|So the disciples said to one another: “No one brought him anything to eat, did he?”
04-34|John|Jesus said to them: “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.
04-35|John|Do you not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to you: Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already
04-36|John|the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
04-37|John|For in this respect the saying is true: One is the sower and another the reaper.
04-38|John|I sent you to reap what you did not labor on. Others have labored, and you have entered into the benefit of their labor.”
04-39|John|Many of the Sa·marʹi·tans from that city put faith in him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, saying: “He told me all the things I did.”
04-40|John|So when the Sa·marʹi·tans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
04-41|John|As a result, many more believed because of what he said,
04-42|John|and they said to the woman: “We no longer believe just because of what you said; for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the savior of the world.”
04-43|John|After the two days, he left there for Galʹi·lee.
04-44|John|Jesus himself, however, bore witness that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland.
04-45|John|So when he arrived in Galʹi·lee, the Gal·i·leʹans welcomed him, because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they too had gone to the festival.
04-46|John|Then he came again to Caʹna of Galʹi·lee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son was sick in Ca·perʹna·um.
04-47|John|When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Ju·deʹa into Galʹi·lee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of dying.
04-48|John|But Jesus said to him: “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”
04-49|John|The royal official said to him: “Lord, come down before my young child dies.”
04-50|John|Jesus said to him: “Go your way; your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he left.
04-51|John|But while he was on his way down, his slaves met him to say that his boy was alive.
04-52|John|So he asked them at what hour he got better. They replied to him: “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”
04-53|John|The father then knew that it was in the very hour that Jesus had said to him: “Your son lives.” So he and his whole household believed.
04-54|John|This was the second sign Jesus performed when he came from Ju·deʹa into Galʹi·lee.
06-01|John|After this Jesus set out across the Sea of Galʹi·lee, or Ti·beʹri·as.
06-02|John|And a large crowd kept following him, because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing in healing the sick.
06-03|John|So Jesus went up on a mountain and sat down there with his disciples.
06-04|John|Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.
06-05|John|When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip: “Where will we buy bread for these people to eat?”
06-06|John|However, he was saying this to test him, for he knew what he was about to do.
06-07|John|Philip answered him: “Two hundred de·narʹi·i worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get even a little.”
06-08|John|One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him
06-09|John|“Here is a little boy who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are these among so many?”
06-10|John|Jesus said: “Have the men sit down.” As there was a lot of grass in that place, the men sat down there, about 5,000 in number.
06-11|John|Jesus took the bread, and after giving thanks, he distributed it to those who were sitting there; he did likewise with the small fish, and they had as much as they wanted.
06-12|John|But when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples: “Gather together the fragments left over, so that nothing is wasted.”
06-13|John|So they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves.
06-14|John|When the people saw the sign he performed, they began to say: “This really is the Prophet who was to come into the world.”
06-15|John|Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain all alone.
06-16|John|When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,
06-17|John|and boarding a boat, they set out across the sea for Ca·perʹna·um. By now it had grown dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
06-18|John|Also, the sea was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing.
06-19|John|However, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and getting near the boat, and they became fearful.
06-20|John|But he said to them: “It is I; do not be afraid!”
06-21|John|Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and right away the boat arrived at the land to which they had been heading.
06-22|John|The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except a small one, and that Jesus had not boarded the boat with his disciples, but his disciples had left by themselves.
06-23|John|Boats from Ti·beʹri·as, however, arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
06-24|John|So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they boarded their boats and came to Ca·perʹna·um to look for Jesus.
06-25|John|When they found him across the sea, they said to him: “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
06-26|John|Jesus answered them: “Most truly I say to you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied.
06-27|John|Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you; for on this one the Father, God himself, has put his seal of approval.”
06-28|John|So they said to him: “What must we do to carry out the works of God?”
06-29|John|In answer Jesus said to them: “This is the work of God, that you exercise faith in the one whom he sent.”
06-30|John|Then they said to him: “What are you performing as a sign, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you doing?
06-31|John|Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”
06-32|John|Jesus then said to them: “Most truly I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
06-33|John|For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”
06-34|John|So they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread.”
06-35|John|Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all, and whoever exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all.
06-36|John|But as I said to you, you have even seen me and yet do not believe.
06-37|John|All those whom the Father gives me will come to me, and I will never drive away the one who comes to me;
06-38|John|for I have come down from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
06-39|John|This is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose none out of all those whom he has given me, but that I should resurrect them on the last day.
06-40|John|For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day.”
06-41|John|Then the Jews began to murmur about him because he had said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”
06-42|John|And they began saying: “Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”
06-43|John|In response Jesus said to them: “Stop murmuring among yourselves.
06-44|John|No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him, and I will resurrect him on the last day.
06-45|John|It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by Jehovah.’ Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned comes to me.
06-46|John|Not that any man has seen the Father, except the one who is from God; this one has seen the Father.
06-47|John|Most truly I say to you, whoever believes has everlasting life.
06-48|John|“I am the bread of life.
06-49|John|Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet they died.
06-50|John|This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.
06-51|John|I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and for a fact, the bread that I will give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”
06-52|John|Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
06-53|John|So Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves.
06-54|John|Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day;
06-55|John|for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.
06-56|John|Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him.
06-57|John|Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will live because of me.
06-58|John|This is the bread that came down from heaven. It is not as when your forefathers ate and yet died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”
06-59|John|He said these things as he was teaching in a synagogue in Ca·perʹna·um.
00-01|Philemon|Paul, a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Phi·leʹmon our beloved fellow worker,
00-02|Philemon|and to Apʹphi·a our sister, and to Ar·chipʹpus our fellow soldier, and to the congregation that is in your house:
00-03|Philemon|May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
00-04|Philemon|I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,
00-05|Philemon|as I keep hearing of your faith and the love that you have for the Lord Jesus and for all the holy ones.
00-06|Philemon|I pray that your sharing in the faith may move you to acknowledge every good thing that we have through Christ.
00-07|Philemon|For I received much joy and comfort on hearing of your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother.
00-08|Philemon|For this very reason, though I have great freeness of speech in connection with Christ to order you to do what is proper,
00-09|Philemon|I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love, seeing that I am Paul an older man, yes, now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus.
00-10|Philemon|I am appealing to you for my child, whose father I became while in prison, O·nesʹi·mus.
00-11|Philemon|He was formerly useless to you, but now he is useful to you and to me.
00-12|Philemon|I am sending him back to you, yes him, my very own heart.
00-13|Philemon|I would like to keep him here for myself so that he might take your place in ministering to me during my imprisonment for the sake of the good news.
00-14|Philemon|But I do not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed may be done, not under compulsion, but of your own free will.
00-15|Philemon|Perhaps this is really why he broke away for a short while, so that you may have him back forever,
00-16|Philemon|no longer as a slave, but as more than a slave, as a brother who is beloved, especially so to me, but how much more so to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
00-17|Philemon|So if you consider me a friend, receive him kindly the same way you would me.
00-18|Philemon|Moreover, if he did you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to my account.
00-19|Philemon|I, Paul, am writing with my own hand: I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me even your own self.
00-20|Philemon|Yes, brother, may I receive this assistance from you in connection with the Lord; refresh my heart in connection with Christ.
00-21|Philemon|I am confident that you will comply, so I am writing you, knowing that you will do even more than what I say.
00-22|Philemon|But along with that, also prepare a place for me to stay, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given back to you.
00-23|Philemon|Sending you greetings is Epʹa·phras, my fellow captive in union with Christ Jesus,
00-24|Philemon|also Mark, Ar·is·tarʹchus, Deʹmas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
00-25|Philemon|The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show.
00-01|2 John|The older man to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I truly love, and not only I but also all those who have come to know the truth,
00-02|2 John|because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever.
00-03|2 John|There will be with us undeserved kindness, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, with truth and love.
00-04|2 John|I rejoice very much because I have found some of your children walking in the truth, just as we received commandment from the Father.
00-05|2 John|So now I request you, lady, that we love one another. (I am writing you, not a new commandment, but one that we had from the beginning.)
00-06|2 John|And this is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should go on walking in it.
00-07|2 John|For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those not acknowledging Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
00-08|2 John|Look out for yourselves, so that you do not lose the things we have worked to produce, but that you may obtain a full reward.
00-09|2 John|Everyone who pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God. The one who does remain in this teaching is the one who has both the Father and the Son.
00-10|2 John|If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him.
00-11|2 John|For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.
00-12|2 John|Although I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to come to you and to speak with you face-to-face, so that your joy may be in full measure.
00-13|2 John|The children of your sister, the chosen one, send you their greetings.
00-01|3 John|The older man to Gaʹius, the beloved, whom I truly love.
00-02|3 John|Beloved one, I pray that in all things you continue to prosper and enjoy good health, just as you are now prospering.
00-03|3 John|For I rejoiced very much when brothers came and bore witness about the truth you hold, as you go on walking in the truth.
00-04|3 John|No greater joy do I have than this: that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth.
00-05|3 John|Beloved one, you show your faithfulness in what you do for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you.
00-06|3 John|They have given a witness about your love before the congregation. Please send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
00-07|3 John|For it was in behalf of his name that they went out, not taking anything from the people of the nations.
00-08|3 John|So we are under obligation to show hospitality to such ones, so that we may become fellow workers in the truth.
00-09|3 John|I wrote something to the congregation, but Di·otʹre·phes, who likes to have the first place among them, does not accept anything from us with respect.
00-10|3 John|That is why if I come, I will call attention to the works he is doing in spreading malicious talk about us. Not being content with this, he refuses to welcome the brothers with respect; and those who want to welcome them, he tries to hinder and to throw out of the congregation.
00-11|3 John|Beloved one, do not imitate what is bad, but imitate what is good. The one who does good originates with God. The one who does bad has not seen God.
00-12|3 John|De·meʹtri·us has been well-reported-on by them all and by the truth itself. In fact, we too are bearing witness about him, and you know that the witness we give is true.
00-13|3 John|I had many things to write you, but I do not wish to go on writing you with pen and ink.
00-14|3 John|However, I am hoping to see you soon, and we will speak face-to-face. May you have peace. The friends send you their greetings. Give my greetings to the friends by name.
00-01|Jude|Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, but a brother of James, to the called ones who are loved by God the Father and preserved for Jesus Christ:
00-02|Jude|May mercy and peace and love be increased to you.
00-03|Jude|Beloved ones, although I was making every effort to write you about the salvation we hold in common, I found it necessary to write you to urge you to put up a hard fight for the faith that was once for all time delivered to the holy ones.
00-04|Jude|My reason is that certain men have slipped in among you who were long ago appointed to this judgment by the Scriptures; they are ungodly men who turn the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for brazen conduct and who prove false to our only owner and Lord, Jesus Christ.
00-05|Jude|Although you are fully aware of all of this, I want to remind you that Jehovah, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those not showing faith.
00-06|Jude|And the angels who did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place, he has reserved with eternal bonds in dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.
00-07|Jude|In the same manner, Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and the cities around them also gave themselves over to gross sexual immorality and pursued unnatural fleshly desires; they are placed before us as a warning example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.
00-08|Jude|Despite this, these men too are indulging in dreams, defiling the flesh, despising authority, and speaking abusively of glorious ones.
00-09|Jude|But when Miʹcha·el the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses’ body, he did not dare to bring a judgment against him in abusive terms, but said: “May Jehovah rebuke you.”
00-10|Jude|But these men are speaking abusively about all the things they really do not understand. And in all the things that they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animals, they go on corrupting themselves.
00-11|Jude|Too bad for them, for they have followed the path of Cain and have rushed into the erroneous course of Baʹlaam for reward, and they have perished in the rebellious talk of Korʹah!
00-12|Jude|These are the rocks hidden below water at your love feasts while they feast with you, shepherds who feed themselves without fear; waterless clouds carried here and there by the wind; fruitless trees in late autumn, having died twice and having been uprooted;
00-13|Jude|wild waves of the sea that cast up the foam of their own shame; stars with no set course, for which the blackest darkness stands reserved forever.
00-14|Jude|Yes, the seventh one in line from Adam, Eʹnoch, also prophesied about them when he said: “Look! Jehovah came with his holy myriads
00-15|Jude|to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.”
00-16|Jude|These men are murmurers, complainers about their lot in life, following their own desires, and their mouths make grandiose boasts, while they are flattering others for their own benefit.
00-17|Jude|As for you, beloved ones, call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00-18|Jude|how they used to say to you: “In the last time there will be ridiculers, following their own desires for ungodly things.”
00-19|Jude|These are the ones who cause divisions, animalistic men, not having spirituality.
00-20|Jude|But you, beloved ones, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, and pray with holy spirit,
00-21|Jude|in order to keep yourselves in God’s love, while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view.
00-22|Jude|Also, continue showing mercy to some who have doubts;
00-23|Jude|save them by snatching them out of the fire. But continue showing mercy to others, doing so with fear, while you hate even the garment that has been stained by the flesh.
00-24|Jude|Now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling and to make you stand unblemished in the sight of his glory with great joy,
00-25|Jude|to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity. Amen.
